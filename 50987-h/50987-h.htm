<p class="drop-cap04">“WE derive our rights in America,” says Edmund Burke, in his
<i>Account of the European Settlements in America</i>, “from the discovery
of Sebastian Cabot, who first made the Northern Continent in 1497.
The fact is sufficiently certain to establish a right to our settlements in
North America.” If this distinguished writer and statesman had substituted
the name of John Cabot for that of Sebastian, he would have stated
the truth.</p>

</div></div>

<p>John Cabot, as his name is known to English readers, or Zuan Caboto,
as it is called in the Venetian dialect, the discoverer of North America, was
born, probably, in Genoa or its neighborhood. His name first appears in
the archives of Venice, where is a record, under the date of March 28,
1476, of his naturalization as a citizen of Venice, after the usual residence
of fifteen years. He pursued successfully the study of cosmography and
the practice of navigation, and at one time visited Arabia,
where, at Mecca, he saw the caravans which came
thither, and was told that the spices they brought were
received from other hands, and that they came originally
from the remotest countries of the east. Accepting
the new views as to “the roundness of the earth,” as
Columbus had done, he was quite disposed to put them
to a practical test. With his wife, who was a Venetian
woman, and his three sons, he removed to England, and
took up his residence at the maritime city of Bristol.
The time at which this removal took place is uncertain.
In the year 1495 he laid his proposals before the king, Henry VII., who on
the 5th of March, 1495/6, granted to him and his three sons, their heirs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
assigns a patent for the discovery of unknown lands in the eastern, western,
or northern seas, with the right to occupy such territories, and to have exclusive
commerce with them, paying to the King one fifth part of all the
profits, and to return to the port of Bristol. The enterprise was to be “at
their own proper cost and charge.” In the early part of May in the following
year, 1497, Cabot set sail from Bristol with one small vessel and eighteen
persons, principally of Bristol, accompanied, perhaps, by his son Sebastian;
and, after sailing seven hundred leagues, discovered land on the 24th of
June, which he supposed was “in the territory of the Grand Cham.” The
legend, “prima tierra vista,” was inscribed on a map attributed to Sebastian
Cabot, composed at a later period, at the head of the delineation of the
island of Cape Breton. On the spot where he landed he planted a large
cross, with the flags of England and of St. Mark, and took possession
for the King of England. If the statement be true that he coasted three
hundred leagues, he may have made a <i>periplus</i> of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
returning home through the Straits of Belle Isle. On his return he saw two
islands on the starboard, but for want of provisions did not stop to examine
them. He saw no human beings, but he brought home certain implements;
and from these and other indications he believed that the country was inhabited.
He returned in the early part of August, having been absent about
three months. The discovery which he reported, and of which he made
and exhibited a map and a solid globe, created a great sensation in England.
The King gave him money, and also executed an agreement to pay
him an annual pension, charged upon the revenues of the port of Bristol.
He dressed in silk, and was called, or called himself, “the Great Admiral.”
Preparations were made for another and a larger expedition, evidently for
the purpose of colonization, and hopes were cherished of further important
discoveries; for Cabot believed that by starting from the place already
found, and coasting toward the equinoctial, he should discover the island
of Cipango, the land of jewels and spices, by which they hoped to make
in London a greater warehouse of spices than existed in Alexandria.
His companions told marvellous stories about the abundance of fish in
the waters of that coast, which might foster an enterprise that would
wholly supersede the fisheries of Iceland. On the 3d of February 1497/8
the King granted to John Cabot (the sons are not named) a license to
take up six ships, and to enlist as many men as should be willing to go
on the new expedition. He set sail, says Hakluyt, quoting Fabian, in the
beginning of May, with, it is supposed, three hundred men, and accompanied
by his son Sebastian. One of the vessels put back to Ireland in
distress, but the others continued on their voyage. This is the last we hear
of John Cabot. His maps are lost. It is believed that Juan de la Cosa,
the Spanish pilot, who in the year 1500 made a map of the Spanish and
English discoveries in the New World, made use of maps of the Cabots
now lost.</p>

<p>Sebastian Cabot, the second son of John Cabot, was born in Venice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
probably about the year 1473. He was early devoted to the study of
cosmography, in which science his father had become a proficient, and
Sebastian was largely imbued with the same spirit of enterprise; and on
the removal of his father with his family to England, he lived with them at
Bristol. His name first occurs in the letters patent of Henry VII., dated
March 5, 1495/6, issued to John Cabot and his three sons, Lewis, Sebastian,
and Sancius, and to their heirs and assigns, authorizing them to
discover unknown lands. There is some reason to believe that he accompanied
his father in the expedition, already mentioned, on which the first
discovery of North America was made; but in none of the contemporary
documents which have recently come to light respecting this voyage is Sebastian’s
name mentioned as connected with it. A second expedition, as
already stated, followed, and John Cabot is distinctly named as having sailed
with it as its commander; but thenceforward he passes out of sight. Sebastian
Cabot, without doubt, accompanied the expedition. No contemporary
account of it was written, or at least published, and for the incidents of the
voyage we are mainly indebted to the reports of others written at a later
period, and derived originally from conversations with Sebastian Cabot himself;
in all of which the father’s name, except incidentally, as having taken
Sebastian to England when he was very young, is not mentioned. In these
several reports but one voyage is spoken of, and that, apparently, the voyage
on which the discovery of North America was made; but circumstances are
narrated in them which could have taken place only on the second or a later
voyage.</p>

<p>With a company of three hundred men, the little fleet steered its course
in the direction of the northwest in search of the land of Cathay. They
came to a coast running to the north, which they followed to a great distance,
where they found, in the month of July, large bodies of ice floating
in the water, and almost continual daylight. Failing to find the passage
sought around this formidable headland, they turned their prows and, as
one account says, sought refreshment at Baccalaos. Thence, coasting
southwards, they ran down to about the latitude of Gibraltar, or 36° N.,
still in search of a passage to India, when, their provisions failing, they
returned to England.</p>

<p>If the views expressed by John Cabot, on his return from his first voyage,
had been seriously cherished, it seems strange that this expedition did
not, at first, on arriving at the coast, pursue the more southerly direction,
where he was confident lay the land of jewels and spices.</p>

<p>They landed in several places, saw the natives dressed in skins of beasts,
and making use of copper. They found the fish in such great abundance
that the progress of the ships was sometimes impeded. The bears, which
were in great plenty, caught the fish for food,&mdash;plunging into the water,
fastening their claws into them, and dragging them to the shore. The
expedition was expected back by September, but it had not returned by
the last of October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>There is some evidence that Sebastian Cabot, at a later period, sailed
on a voyage of discovery from England in company with Sir Thomas
Pert, or Spert, but which, on account of the cowardice of his companion,
“took none effect.” But the enterprise is involved in doubt and
obscurity.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In 1512, after the death of Henry VII., and when Henry VIII. had
been three years on the throne, Sebastian
Cabot entered into the service of Ferdinand,
King of Spain, arriving at Seville
in September of that year, where he took
up his residence; and on the 20th of
October was appointed “Capitan de Mar,” with an annual salary of fifty
thousand maravedis.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Preparations for a voyage of discovery were now
made, and Cabot was to depart in March, 1516, but the death of Ferdinand
prevented his sailing. On the 5th of February, 1518, he was
named, by Charles V., “Piloto Mayor y Exâminadór de Pilotos,” as successor
of Juan de Solis, who was killed at La Plata in 1516. This office
gave him an additional salary of fifty thousand maravedis; and it was
soon afterwards decreed that no pilots should leave Spain for the Indies
without being examined and approved by him. In 1524 he attended,
not as a member but as an expert, the celebrated junta at Badajoz,
which met to decide the important question of the longitude of the
Moluccas,&mdash;whether they were on the Spanish or the Portuguese side of
the line of demarcation which followed, by papal consent in 1494, a
meridian of longitude, making a fixed division of the globe, so far as
yet undefined, between Spain and Portugal. On the second day of the
session, April 15, he and two others delivered an opinion on the questions
involved.</p>

<p>In the following year an expedition to the Moluccas was projected, and
under an agreement with the Emperor, executed at Madrid on the 4th of
March, Sebastian Cabot was appointed its commander with the title of
Captain-General. The sailing of the expedition was delayed by the intrigues
of the Portuguese. In the mean time his wife, Catalina Medrano,
who is again mentioned with her children a few years later, received by a
royal order fifty thousand maravedis as a <i>gratificacion</i>. On April 3, 1526,
the armada sailed from St. Lucar for the Spice Islands, intending to pass
through the Straits of Magellan. It was delayed from point to point, and
did not arrive on the coast until the following year, when Cabot entered the
La Plata River. A feeling of disloyalty to their commander, the seeds of
which had been sown from the beginning, broke out in open mutiny. He
had, moreover, lost one of his vessels off the coast of Brazil. He therefore
determined to proceed no farther at present, to send to the Emperor a
report of the condition of affairs, and in the mean time to explore the La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Plata River, which had been penetrated by De Solis in 1515. He remained
in that country for several years, and returned in July or August, 1530.
The details of this expedition are described in another volume of this work
and by another hand.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, this enterprise was regarded at home as a
failure, and Cabot had made many enemies in the exercise of his legitimate
authority in quelling the mutinies which had from time to time broken out
among his men. Complaints were made against him on his return. Several
families of those of his companions who were killed in the expedition
brought suits against him, and he was arrested and imprisoned, but was
liberated on bail. Public charges for misconduct in the affairs of La Plata
were preferred against him; and the Council of the Indies, by an order dated
from Medina del Campo, Feb. 1, 1532, condemned him to a banishment of
two years to Oran, in Africa. I have seen no evidence to show that this
sentence was carried into execution. Cabot, who on his return laid before
the Emperor Charles V. his final report on the expedition, appears to have
fully justified himself in that monarch’s esteem; for he soon resumed
his duties as Pilot Major, an office which he retained till his final return
to England.</p>

<p>Cabot made maps and globes during his residence in Spain; and
a large <i>mappe monde</i> bearing date 1544, engraved on copper, and attributed
to him, was found in Germany in 1843, and is now deposited in
the National Library in Paris. This map has been the subject of much
discussion. While in the employ of the Emperor, Cabot offered his
services to his native country, Venice, but was unable to carry his purpose
into effect. He was at last desirous of returning to England, and
the Privy Council, on Oct. 9, 1547, issued a warrant for his transportation
from Spain “to serve and inhabit in England.” He
came over to England in that or the following year,
and on Jan. 6, 1548/9, the King granted him a pension
of £166 13s. 4d., to date from St. Michael’s
Day preceding (September 29), “in consideration of
the good and acceptable service done and to be
done” by him. In 1550 the Emperor, through his ambassador in England,
demanded his return to Spain, saying that Cabot was his Pilot
Major under large pay, and was much needed by him,&mdash;that “he could
not stand the king in any great stead, seeing he had but small practice
in those seas;” but Cabot declined to return. In that same year, June 4,
the King renewed to him the patent of 1495/6, and in March, 1551, gave
him £200 as a special reward.</p>

<p>The discovery of a passage to China by the northwest having been
deemed impracticable, a company of merchants was formed in 1553 to
prosecute a route by the northeast, and Cabot was made its governor. He
drew up the instructions for its management, and the expedition under Willoughby
was sent out, the results of which are well known. China was not
reached, but a trade with Muscovy was opened through Archangel. After
the accession of Mary to the Crown of England, the Emperor made another
unsuccessful demand for Cabot’s return to Spain. On Feb. 6, 1555/6, what
is known as the Muscovy Company was chartered, and Cabot became its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
governor. Among the last notices preserved of this venerable man is
an account, by a quaint old chronicler, of his presence at Gravesend,
April 27, 1556, on board the pinnace, the “Serchthrift,” then destined for a
voyage of discovery to the northeast. It is related that after Sebastian
Cabot, “and divers gentlemen and gentlewomen” had “viewed our pinnace,
and tasted of such cheer as we could make them aboard, they went on shore,
giving to our mariners right liberal rewards; and the good old Gentleman,
Master Cabota, gave to the poor most liberal alms, wishing them to pray for
the good fortune and prosperous success of the ‘Serchthrift,’ our pinnace.
And then at the sign of the ‘Christopher,’ he and his friends banqueted,
and made me and them that were in the company great cheer; and for very
joy that he had to see the towardness of our intended discovery he entered
into the dance himself, amongst the rest of the young and lusty company,&mdash;which
being ended, he and his friends departed most gently commending us
to the governance of Almighty God.”</p>

<p>Cabot’s pension, granted by the late King, was renewed to him by
Queen Mary Nov. 27, 1555; but on May 27, 1557, he resigned it, and two
days later a new grant was issued to him and William Worthington, jointly,
of the same amount, by which he was deprived
of one half his pay. This is the
last official notice of Sebastian Cabot.
He probably died soon afterwards, and
in London. Richard Eden, the translator and compiler, attended him in
his last moments, and “beckons us, with something of awe, to see him
die.” He gives a touching account of the feeble and broken utterances
of the dying man. Though no monument or gravestone marks his place
of burial, which is unknown, his portrait is preserved, as shown on a
preceding page.</p>

<h3><a name="c7" id="c7">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">UNLIKE the enterprises of Columbus, Vespucius, and many other navigators who
wrote accounts of their voyages and discoveries at the time of their occurrence,
which by the aid of the press were published to the world, the exploits of the Cabots
were unchronicled. Although the fact of their voyages had been reported by jealous
and watchful liegers at the English Court to the principal cabinets of the Continent, and
the map of their discoveries had been made known, and this had had its influence in leading
other expeditions to the northern shores of North America, the historical literature
relating to the discovery of America, as preserved in print, is, for nearly twenty years after
the events took place, silent as to the enterprises and even the names of the Cabots.
Scarcely anything has come down to us directly from these navigators themselves, and
for what we know we have hitherto been chiefly indebted to the uncertain reports, in
foreign languages, of conversations originally held with Sebastian Cabot many years
afterwards, and sometimes related at second and third hand. Even the year in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the voyage of discovery was made was usually wrongly stated, when stated at all, and
for more than two hundred years succeeding these events there was no mention made

<p>John Cabot had died when his son Sebastian in 1512, three years after the death of
Henry VII., left England and entered into the service of the King of Spain, who gave
him the title of Captain, and a liberal allowance, directing that he should reside at
Seville to await orders. He there became an intimate friend of the famous Peter Martyr,
the author of the <i>Decades of the New World</i>, or <i>De Orbe Novo</i>, and a volume of letters
entitled <i>Opus Epistolarum</i>, etc., a writer too well known to need further introduction here.
Through Martyr, for the first time, there was printed in 1516 an account of the voyage of
the Cabots.</p>

<p class="p1">“These northern shores have been searched by one Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian born, whom,
being but in manner an infant, his parents carried with them into England, having occasion to
resort thither for trade of merchandise, as is the manner of the Venetians to leave no part of the
world unsearched to obtain riches. He therefore furnished two ships in England at his own
charges, and first with three hundred men directed his course so far towards the North Pole that
even in the month of July he found monstrous heaps of ice swimming on the sea, and in manner
continual daylight; yet saw he the land in that tract free from ice, which had been molten. Wherefore
he was enforced to turn his sails and follow the west; so coasting still by the shore that he
was thereby brought so far into the south, by reason of the land bending so much southwards that
it was there almost equal in latitude with the sea <i>Fretum Herculeum</i>. He sailed so far towards the
west that he had the island of Cuba on his left hand in manner in the same degree of longitude.
As he travelled by the coasts of this great land (which he named Baccalaos) he saith that he found
the like course of the waters toward the great west, but the same to run more softly and gently
than the swift waters which the Spaniards found in their navigation southward.... Sebastian
Cabot himself named these lands Baccalaos, because that in the seas thereabout he found so great
multitudes of certain big fishes much like unto tunnies (which the inhabitants call <i>baccallaos</i>)<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
that they sometimes staied his ships. He also found the people of those regions covered with
beasts’ skins, yet not without the use of reason. He also saith
there is great plenty of bears in
those regions which use to eat fish; for plunging themselves into the water, where they perceive a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
multitude of these fishes to lie, they fasten their claws in their scales, and so draw them to land
and eat them, so (as he saith) they are not noisome to men. He declareth further, that in many
places of those regions he saw great plenty of laton among the inhabitants. Cabot is my very
friend, whom I use familiarly, and delight to have him sometimes keep me company in mine own
house. For being called out of England by the commandment of the Catholic king of Castile, after
the death of Henry VII. King of England, he is now present at Court with us, looking for ships to
be furnished him for the Indies, to discover this hid secret of Nature. I think that he will depart
in March in the year next following, 1516, to explore it. What shall succeed your Holiness shall
learn through me, if God grant me life. Some of the Spaniards deny that Cabot was the first
finder of the land of Baccalaos, and affirm that he went not so far westward.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>

          <p class="pf400">[The legends on the map even on the large
scale are not clear, and Brunet, <i>Supplement</i>,
p. 697, gives a deceptive account of them. The
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p. 54, makes them thus:
On North America, “Ortus de bona ventura,”
and “Isabella.” Hispaniola is called “Spagnolla.”
On the northern shore of South Ameica,
“Arcay” and “Caput de Sta de.” On its
eastern parts, “Gorffo Fremosa,” “Caput S.
Crucis,” and “Monte Fregoso.” At the southern
limit, “Alla pega.” The straight lines of
the western coasts, as well as the words “Terra
incognita,” are thought to represent an uncertainty
of knowledge. The island at the west is
“Zypangu insula,” or Japan. Mr. Bartlett, the
editor of the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, is of the
opinion that the island at the north is Iceland;
but it seems more in accordance with the prevailing
notions of the time to call it Baccalaos. It appears
in the same way on the Lenox globe, and
in the circumpolar MS. map of Da Vinci (1513)
in the Queen’s library at Windsor, where this
island is marked “Bacalar.” The eastern coast
outline of the Stobnicza map bears a certain
resemblance to the Waldseemüller map which
appeared in the Ptolemy of 1513, having been
however engraved, but not published, in 1507,
and Stobnicza may have seen it. If so, he
might have intended the straight western line
of North America to correspond to the marginal
limit of the Ptolemy map; but he got no warrant
in the latter for the happy conjecture of
the western coast of the Southern Continent,
nor could he find such anywhere else, so far as
we know. The variations of the eastern coast
do not indicate that he depended, solely at least,
upon the Ptolemy map, which carries the northern
cut-off of the northern continent five degrees
higher. “Isabella” is transferred from
Cuba to Florida, and the northeast coast of
South America is very different. There are accurate
fac-similes of this Ptolemy map in Varnhagen’s
<i>Premier Voyage de Vespucci</i>, and in Stevens’s
<i>Historical and Geographical Notes</i>, pl. ii.

<p class="p1">This account we may well suppose to have come primarily from Sebastian Cabot himself,
and it will be noticed that his father is not mentioned as having accompanied him on
the voyage. Indeed, no reference is made to the father except under the general statement
that his parents took him to England while he was yet very young, <i>pene infans</i>.
No date is given, and but one voyage is spoken of. It may be said that Peter Martyr is
not here writing a history of the voyage or voyages of the Cabots; that the account is
merely brought into his narrative incidentally, as it were, to illustrate a subject upon
which he was then writing,&mdash;namely, on a “search” into “the secret causes of Nature,” or
the reason “why the sea runneth with so swift course from the east into the west;” and
that he cites the observations of Sebastian Cabot, in the region of the Baccalaos, for his
immediate purpose. Richard Biddle, in his <i>Life of Sebastian Cabot</i>, pp. 81-90, supposes
the voyage here described to be the second, that of 1498, undertaken after the death of the
father, as the mention of the three hundred men taken out would imply a purpose of
colonization, while the first voyage was one of discovery merely; and thinks that this view
is confirmed by a subsequent reference of Martyr to Cabot’s discovery of the Baccalaos,
in <i>Decade</i> seven, chapter two, written in 1524, where the discovery is said to have taken
place “twenty-six years before,” that is, in 1498.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A map of the world was composed in 1529 by Diego Ribero, a very able cosmographer
and map-maker of Spain in the early part of the sixteenth century. It is a very interesting
map, but is so well known to geographers that I need give no particular description of
it here. The northern part of our coast, delineated upon it, is supposed to have been
drawn from the explorations and reports of Gomez made in 1525. It was copied and
printed, in its general features only, in 1534, at Venice. A superior copy in fac-simile
of the original map was published by Dr. Kohl in 1860, at Weimar, in his <i>Die beiden
Æltesten General-Karten von Amerika</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> On this map an inscription, of which the following
is an English version, is placed over the territory inscribed Tierra del Labrador:
“This country the English discovered, but there is nothing useful in it.” See an abridged
section of the map and a description of it in Kohl’s <i>Doc. Hist. of Maine</i>, i. 299-307.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1530, four years after Martyr’s death, there was published at Alcala (Complutum),
in Spain, his eight Decades, <i>De Orbe Novo</i>, which included the three first published in
1516, in the last of which, the third, appeared the notice of Sebastian Cabot cited above.
And it may be added here that the three Decades, including the <i>De nuper ... repertis insulis</i>,
etc., or abridgment, so called, of the fourth Decade, printed at Basel in 1521, were
reprinted together in that city in 1533. Of later editions there will be occasion to say
something farther on. Martyr’s notice of Cabot was the earliest extant, and the republication
of these Decades, at different places, served to keep alive the important fact of the
discovery of North America under the English flag. In some of these later Decades,
written in 1524 and 1525, references will be found to Sebastian Cabot and to his employment
in Spain.</p>

<p>There was published in Latin at Argentoratum (Strasbourg), in 1532, by James
Ziegler,&mdash;a Bavarian theologian, who cultivated mathematics and cosmography with
success,&mdash;a book relating in part to the northern regions. Under the head of “Gronland”
the author quotes Peter Martyr’s account of Sebastian Cabot’s voyage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Peter Martyr of Angleria writeth in his Decades of the Spanish navigations, that Sebastian
Cabot,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> sailing from England continually towards the north, followed that course so far that he
chanced upon great flakes of ice in the month of July; and diverting from thence he followed the
coast by the shore, bending toward the south until he came to the clime of the island of Hispaniola
above Cuba, an Island of the Cannibals. Which narration hath given me occasion to extend
Gronland beyond the promontory or cape of Huitsarch to the continent or firm land of Lapponia
above the castle of Wardhus; which thing I did the rather for that the reverend Archbishop of
Nidrosia constantly affirmed that the sea bendeth there into the form of a crooked elbow.”</p>

<p class="p1">This writer evidently supposed that Cabot sailed along the east coast of Greenland, and
the inference he drew from Cabot’s experience, as related by Martyr, confirmed his belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that that country joined on to Lappona (Lapland),&mdash;an old notion which lasted down
to the time of Willoughby,&mdash;making “one continent;” and so he represented it on
his map no. 8, published in his book.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He places “Terra Bacallaos” on the east coast
of “Gronland.” He believed that Cabot’s falling in with ice proved “that he sailed not
by the main sea, but in places near unto the land, comprehending and embracing the sea in
the form of a gulf.” I have copied this from Eden’s English version of Ziegler (<i>Decades</i>,
fol. 268), in the margin of which at this place Eden says, “Cabot told me that this ice is
of fresh water, and not of the sea.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>There was published at Venice in 1534, in Italian, a volume in three parts; the first
of which was entitled, <i>Summario de la generale historia de l’indie occidentali cavato da
libri scritti dal signor don Pietro Martyre del consiglio delle indie della maesta de l’imperadore,
et da molte altre particulari relationi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This, as will be seen, purports to be a summary drawn from Peter Martyr and
other sources,&mdash;“from many other private accounts.” The basis of the work is Martyr’s
first three Decades, published together in Latin in 1516, the original arrangement of the
author being entirely disregarded, many facts omitted, and new statements introduced for
which no authority is given. By virtue of the concluding words of the quoted title, the
translator or compiler appears to claim the privilege of taking the utmost liberty with the
text of Martyr. For the well-known passage in the sixth chapter of the third Decade,
where Martyr says that Sebastian Cabot “sed a parentibus in Britāniam insulam tendentibus,
uti moris est Venetorum: qui commercii causa terrarum omnium sunt hospites transportatus
pene infans” (“whom being yet but in manner an infant, his parents carried with
them into England, having occasion to resort thither for trade of merchandise, as is the
manner of the Venetians to leave no part of the world unsearched to obtain riches”), the
Italian translator has substituted, “Costui essendo piccolo fu menato da suo padre in
Inghilterra, da poi la morte del quale trouandosi ricchissimo, et di grande animo, delibero
si come hauea fatto Christoforo Colombo voler anchor lui scoprire qualche nuoua parte
del mōdo,” etc. (“He being a little boy was taken by his father into England, after
whose death, finding himself very rich and of great ambition, he resolved to discover some
new part of the world as Columbus had done”).</p>

<p>M. D’Avezac has given some facts which show that the editor of this Italian version of
Peter Martyr, as he calls this work, was Ramusio, the celebrated editor of the <i>Navigationi et
Viaggi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> etc., and this work is introduced into the third volume of that publication, twenty-one
years later. Mr. Brevoort has also called my attention to the fact that the woodcut
of “Isola Spagnuola,” used in the early work, was introduced into the later one, which is
confirmatory of the opinion that Ramusio was at least the editor of the <i>Summario</i> of 1534.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Cabot we know was, during his residence in Spain, a correspondent of Ramusio,&mdash;at
least, the latter speaks once of Cabot’s having written to him, and we shall see farther on
that they were not strangers to each other,&mdash;and it is possible that this modification of
Peter Martyr’s language was authorized by him. It is here stated, however, that Cabot
reached only 55° north, while in the prefatory <i>Discorso</i> to his third volume the editor
says that Cabot wrote to him many years before that he reached the latitude of 67 degrees
and a half, and no explanation is given as to whether the reference is to the same voyage.
A fair inference from the passage above cited from the Italian <i>Summario</i> would be that
Sebastian Cabot planned the voyage of discovery after his father’s death, which we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was not true; as it was equally untrue that the death of his father made him very rich,
for the Italian envoy tells us that John Cabot was poor. Indeed, the whole language of
the passage relating to Sebastian Cabot is mythical and untrustworthy, whoever may have
inspired it.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I now come to a map of Sebastian Cabot, bearing date 1544, as the year of its composition,
a copy of which was discovered in Germany in 1843, by Von Martius, in the house
of a Bavarian curate, and deposited in the following year in the National Library in Paris.
It has been described at some length by M. D’Avezac, in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de
Géographie</i>, 4 ser. xiv. 268-270, 1857. It is a large elliptical <i>mappe monde</i>, engraved on
metal, with geographical delineations drawn upon it down to the time it was made. I saw
the map in Paris in 1866. On its sides are two tables: the first, on the left, inscribed
at the head “Tabula Prima;” and that on the right, “Tabula Secunda.” On these
tables are seventeen legends, or inscriptions, in duplicate; that is to say, in Spanish and in
Latin, the latter supposed to be a translation of the former,&mdash;each Latin legend immediately
following the Spanish original and bearing the same number.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>After the seventeen legends in Spanish and in Latin, we come to a title or heading:
“Plinio en el secund libro capitulo lxxix., escriue” (“Pliny, in the second book, chapter 79,
writes”). Then follows an inscription in Spanish, no. 18, from Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i>,
cap. lxvii., the chapter given above being an error. Four brief inscriptions, also in Spanish,
numbered 19 to 22, relating to the natural productions of islands in the eastern seas, taken
from other authors, complete the list. So there are twenty-two Spanish inscriptions or
legends on the map,&mdash;ten on the first table and twelve on the second,&mdash;the last five of
which have no Latin <i>exemplaires</i>; and there are no Latin inscriptions without the same
text in Spanish immediately preceding.</p>

<p>There are no headings prefixed to the inscriptions, except the 1st, the 17th, and 18th.
The first inscription, relating to the discovery of the New World by Columbus, has this
title, beneath Tabula Prima, “<i>del almirante</i>.” The 17th&mdash;a long inscription&mdash;has this
title: <i>Retulo, del auctor conçiertas razones de la variaçion que haze il aguia del marear
con la estrella del Norte</i> (“A discourse of the author of the map, giving certain reasons for
the variation of the magnetic needle in reference to the North Star”). It is also repeated
in Latin over the version of the inscription in that language. The title to the 18th inscription,
if it may be called a title, has already been given.</p>

<p>The 17th inscription begins as follows: “Sebastian Caboto, capitan y piloto mayor
de la S. c. c. m. del Imperador don Carlos quinto deste nombre, y Rey nuestro sennor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>hizo este figura extenda en plano, anno del nascim<sup>o</sup> de nrō Salvador Iesu Christo de

como Portugueses, y parte por su padre, y por el descubierto, por donde, podras

(“Sebastian Cabot, captain and pilot-major of his sacred imperial majesty, the emperor
Don Carlos, the fifth of this name, and the king our lord, made this figure extended on a
plane surface, in the year of the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, 1544, having drawn it
by degrees of latitude and longitude, with the winds, as a sailing chart, following partly
Ptolemy and partly the modern discoveries, Spanish and Portuguese, and partly the discovery
made by his father and himself: by it you may sail as by a sea-chart, having regard
to the variation of the needle,” etc.). Then follows a discussion relating to the variation of
the magnetic needle, which Cabot claims first to have noticed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In the inscription, No. 8, which treats of Newfoundland, it says: “This country was
discovered by John Cabot, a Venetian, and Sebastian Cabot, his son, in the year of our
Lord Jesus Christ, MCCCCXCIV. [1494] on the 24th of June, in the morning, which
country they called ‘primum visam’; and a large island adjacent to it they named the
island of St. John, because they discovered it on the same day.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A fac-simile of this map was published in Paris by M. Jomard, in Plate XX. of his
<i>Monuments de la Géographie</i> (begun in 1842, and issued during several years following
down to 1862), but without the legends on its sides, which unquestionably belong to the
map itself; for those which, on account of their length, are not included within the interior
of the map, are attached to it by proper references. M. Jomard promised a separate volume
of “texte explicatif,” but death prevented the accomplishment of his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>If this map, with the date of its composition, is authentic, it is the first time the name
of John Cabot has been introduced to our notice in any printed document, in connection
with the discovery of North America. Here the name is brought in jointly with that of
Sebastian Cabot, on the authority apparently of Sebastian himself. He is said to be the
maker of the map, and if he did not write the legends on its sides he may be supposed not
to have been ignorant of their having been placed there. As to Legend No. 8, copied
above, who but Sebastian Cabot would know the facts embodied in it,&mdash;namely, that the
discovery was made by both the father and the son, on the 24th of June, about five o’clock
in the morning; that the land was called <i>prima vista</i>, or its equivalent, and that the island
near by was called St. John, as the discovery was made on St. John’s Day? Whether or
not Sebastian Cabot’s statement is to be implicitly relied on, in associating his own name
with his father’s in the voyage of discovery, in view of the evidence which has recently
come to light, the legend itself must have proceeded from him. Some additional information
in the latter part of the inscription, relating to the native inhabitants, and the productions
of the country, may have been gathered in the voyage of the following year.
Sebastian Cabot, without doubt, was in possession of his father’s maps, on which would be
inscribed by John Cabot himself the day on which the discovery was made.</p>

<p>Whatever opinions, therefore, historical scholars may entertain as to Sebastian Cabot’s
connection with this map in its present form, or with the inscriptions upon it as a whole,
all must admit that the statements embodied in No. 8, and, it may be added, in No. 17,
could have been communicated by no one but Sebastian Cabot himself. The only alternative
is that they are a base fabrication by a stranger. Moreover, this very map itself, or a
map with these legends upon it, as we shall see farther on, was in the possession of Richard
Eden, or was accessible to him; and one of its long inscriptions was translated into English,
and printed in his <i>Decades</i>, in 1555, as from “Cabot’s own card,”&mdash;and this at a time
when Cabot was living in London, and apparently on terms of intimacy with Eden. Legend
No. 8 contains an important statement which is confirmed by evidence recently come
to light, namely, the fact of John Cabot’s agency in the discovery of North America; and,
although the name of the son is here associated with the father, it is a positive relief to find
an acknowledgment from Sebastian himself of a truth that was to receive, before the close
of the century, important support from the publication of the <i>Letters Patent</i> from the
archives of the State. And this should serve to modify our estimate of the authenticity of
reports purporting to come from Sebastian, in which the father is wholly ignored, and the
son alone is represented as the hero. The long inscription, No. 17, contains an honorable
mention of his father, as we have already seen; and in the Latin duplicate, the language
in the passage which I have given in English will be seen to be even more emphatic than
is expressed in the Spanish text. Indeed, in several instances in the Latin, though generally
following the Spanish, so far as I have had an opportunity of observing, there are
some statements of fact not to be found in the Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The passage already cited concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
thus in the Latin: “And also from the experience and practice of long sea-service
of the most excellent John Cabot, a Venetian by nation, and of my author [the map is here
made to speak for itself] Sebastian his son, the most learned of all men in knowledge of
the stars and the art of navigation, who have discovered a certain part of the globe for
a long time hidden from our people.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Though we are not quite willing to believe that Sebastian Cabot wrote the eulogy of
himself contained in this passage, yet who but he could have known of those facts concerning
his father, who, we suppose, had been dead some fifty years before this map was
composed?</p>

<p>The map itself, as a work of Sebastian Cabot, is unsatisfactory, and many of the
legends on its sides are also unworthy of its alleged author. It brought forward for
the first time, in Legend 8, the year 1494 as the year of the discovery of North America,
which the late M. D’Avezac accepted, but which I cannot but think from undoubted
evidence, to be adduced farther on, is wrong. The “terram primum visam” of the legend
is inscribed on the northern part of Cape Breton, and there would seem to be no good
reason for not accepting this point on the coast as Cabot’s landfall. The “y de s. Juan,”
the present Prince Edward Island, is laid down on the map; and although Dr. Kohl thinks
that the name was given by the French, and that Cabot may have taken it, not from his
own survey, but from the French maps, I have seen no evidence of the application of the
name on any map before this of Cabot. Cartier gave the name “Sainct Jean” to a cape
on the west coast of Newfoundland, in 1534, discovered also on St. John’s Day; but this
fact was not known, in print at least, till 1556, when the account of his first voyage was
published in the third volume of Ramusio.</p>

<p>We find no strictly contemporaneous reference to this map, or evidence that it exerted
any influence on opinions respecting the first two voyages of the Cabots; and the name of
John Cabot again sinks out of sight. Dr. Kohl has called attention to the fact that the author
of this map has copied the coast line of the northern shore largely from Ribero.</p>

<p>It may be added that the inscription No. 8, on Cabot’s map, has since its republication
by Hakluyt, with an English version by him, in 1589, been regarded as containing the most
definite and satisfactory statement which had appeared as to the discovery of North America,
the date as to the year having been subjected to some interesting criticisms, to be
referred to farther on.</p>

<p>In the year 1550 Ramusio issued at Venice the first volume of his celebrated collection
of voyages and travels in Italian, entitled, <i>Delle Navigationi et Viaggi</i>, etc. This contained,
in a discourse on spices, etc., the well-known report of a conversation at the villa
of Hieronymo Fracastor, at Caphi, near Verona, in which the principal speaker, a most
profound philosopher and mathematician, incidentally relates an interview which he had,
some years before, with Sebastian Cabot at Seville. Ramusio, who was present, and tells
the story himself, says he does not pretend to give the conversation precisely as he heard
it, for that would require a talent beyond his; but he would try and give briefly what he
could recollect of it. The substance of Cabot’s story as related, much abridged by me,
is this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Sebastian Cabot’s father took him from Venice to London when he was very young,
yet having some knowledge of the <i>humanities</i>, and of the sphere. His father died at
the time when the news was brought of the discovery of Columbus, which caused a
great talk at the court of Henry VII., and which created a great desire in him (Cabot) to
attempt some great thing; and understanding, by reason of the sphere, that if he should
sail by the northwest he would come to India by a shorter route, he caused the king to be
informed of his idea, and the king immediately furnished him with two small ships, and all
things necessary for the voyage, which was in the year 1496, in the beginning of summer.
He therefore began to sail to the northwest, expecting to go to Cathay, and from thence to
turn towards India, but found after some days, to his displeasure, that the land ran towards
the north. He still proceeded hoping to find the passage, but found the land still continent
to the 56th degree; and seeing there that the coast turned toward the east, he, in despair of
finding the passage, turned back and sailed down the coast toward the equinoctial, ever
hoping to find the passage, and came as far south as Florida, when, his provisions failing,
he returned to England, where he found great tumults among the people, and wars in
Scotland.</p>

<p>The volumes of Ramusio became justly celebrated throughout the literary centres of
Europe, and the publication of the account of Sebastian Cabot’s discovery in the first
volume attracted the attention of scholars in England. It will be noticed that Sebastian
Cabot here, as well as in the account in Peter Martyr, is said to have been born in Venice,
and taken to England while yet very young; yet not so young but that he had acquired
some knowledge of letters, and of the sphere. He speaks here of the death of his father as
occurring before the voyage of discovery was entered upon, for which he had two small
ships furnished him by the king. He says that this was in the year 1496; yet he speaks of
events occurring in England on his return,&mdash;great tumults among the people, and wars in
Scotland,&mdash;which point to the year 1497. The latitude he reached “under our pole” was
56 degrees; and, despairing to find the passage to India, he turned back again, sailed down
the coast, “and came to that part of this firm land we now call Florida.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Many incidents
here described could not have occurred on the voyage of discovery, as we shall see
farther on.</p>

<p>We do not know the precise year in which the interview at Seville between this learned
man and Sebastian Cabot was held, but have given some reasons below for believing that
it took place about ten years before it was printed by Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>I might mention here another reference to Cabot, in Ramusio’s third volume, 1556,
though of a little later date. In a prefatory dedication to his excellent friend Hieronimo
Fracastor,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> at whose house the conversation related in Ramusio’s first volume took place,
Ramusio under date of June 20, 1553, says that “Sebastian Cabot our countryman, a Venetian,”
wrote to him many years ago that he sailed along and beyond this land of New
France, at the charges of Henry VII. King of England; that he sailed a long time west
and by north into the latitude of 67½ degrees, and on the 11th of June, finding still the sea
open, he expected to have gone on to Cathay, and would have gone, if the mutiny of the
shipmaster and mariners had not hindered him and made him return homewards from
that place.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>I have already briefly referred to this letter, in speaking of the alleged voyage of 1516-17,
contended for by Biddle (pp. 117-19), on which occasion he thinks Cabot entered Hudson
Bay. This passage in Ramusio is mentioned twenty years later by Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, in his tract, as we shall see farther on, principally on account of the high degree of
northern latitude reached, 67½°, and where the sea was found still open.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As this is the
only account of a voyage which describes so high an elevation reached, and an immediate
return thence by reason of mutiny, some have supposed that the incidents described
must have occurred on a third voyage, in company with Sir Thomas Pert. On Cabot’s
map of 1544 there is inscribed a coast line trending westward, terminating at the degree of
latitude named.</p>

<p>In 1552 Gomara’s <i>Historia General de las Indias</i> was published at Saragossa in Spain.
In cap. xxxix., under the head of “Los Baccalaos,” he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Sebastian Cabot was the first that brought any knowledge of this land, for being in England in
the days of King Henry VII. he furnished two ships at his own charges, or (as some say) at the
King’s, whom he persuaded that a passage might be found to Cathay by the North Seas.... He
went also to know what manner of lands those Indies were to inhabit. He had with him three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hundred men, and directed his course by the track of Iceland, upon the Cape of Labrador, at fifty-eight
degrees (though he himself says much more), affirming that in the month of July there was
such cold and heaps of ice that he durst pass no further; that the days were very long and in
manner without night, and the nights very clear. Certain it is that at sixty degrees the longest
day is of 18 hours. But considering the cold and the strangeness of the unknown land, he turned
his course from thence to the west, refreshing themselves at Baccalaos; and following the coast of
the land unto the 38th degree, he returned to England.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Francis Lopez Gomara was among the most distinguished of the historical writers of
Spain. In his <i>History of the Indies</i> his purpose was to give a brief view of the whole
range of Spanish conquest in the islands and on the American continent, as far down
as about the middle of the sixteenth century. He must have known Cabot in Seville, and
might have informed himself as to his early maritime enterprises, but he seems to have
neglected his opportunity. His book was published after Cabot had returned to England.
On one point in the above brief account, namely, as to whether the ships were furnished
at the charge of Cabot, he speaks doubtfully. Peter Martyr had said that Cabot furnished
two ships at his own charge, while Ramusio, in the celebrated <i>Discorso</i>, makes Cabot say
that the king furnished them. As usual but one voyage is spoken of; and Sebastian Cabot
is the only commander, and is called a Venetian. His statement contains little new, and
is principally a repetition of Peter Martyr. There is added the statement that the expedition,
on returning from the northern coasting, “refreshed at Baccalaos.” The degrees
given, as to the latitude and longitude reached in sailing both north and south, appear to be
an inference from Martyr and Ramusio. The incidents here related of course refer to the
second voyage. Gomara, in his history, has other notices of Cabot during his residence
in Spain at a later period, in connection with his account of the junta at Badajos, and the
expedition to the La Plata.</p>

<p>In 1553 Richard Eden, the first English collector of voyages and travels, published in
London a translation “out of Latin into English” of the fifth book of the <i>Universal Cosmographia</i>
of Sebastian Münster, entitling it <i>A Treatise of the Newe India</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> etc. In the dedication
of the book to the Duke of Northumberland, who had been Lord High Admiral of
England under Henry VIII., Eden says, incidentally, that “King Henry VIII. about the
same year of his reign [i. e. between April 1516 and April 1517], furnished and sent forth
certain ships under the gouvernance of Sebastian Cabot yet living, and one Sir Thomas
Pert, whose faint heart was the cause that the voyage took none effect;” and that if
manly courage “had not at that time been wanting, it might happily have come to pass that
that rich treasure called Perularia, which is now in Spain in the city of Sivil, and so named
for that in it is kept the infinite riches brought hither from the new-found-land of Peru,
might long since have been in the Tower of London, to the king’s great honor and wealth
of this his realm.”</p>

<p>I find no notice taken of this statement of Eden, at the time, and it is only when we
come down to the publication of Hakluyt’s folio, in 1589, that we see an attempt made to
attach some importance to it. Although deviating a little from the chronological order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this narrative, I propose here to bring together what I may have to say concerning this
voyage.</p>

<p>Dr. Kohl<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> very properly says that this incidental remark of Eden is all the original
evidence we have on this so-called expedition of Cabot in 1516, to which some modern
writers attach great importance, and by which great discoveries are said to have been
made under Henry VIII. Hakluyt, in his folio of 1589, p. 515, copies the language of
Eden cited above, and also an abstract from a spurious Italian version of Oviedo, in Ramusio’s
collections, in which that writer is made to say that a Spanish vessel in the year 1517
fell in with an English rover at the islands of St. Domingo and St. John’s in the West
Indies, on their way from Brazil; and concludes that this English rover could be none
other than the vessel of Cabot and Pert. But Richard Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> nearly two hundred and
fifty years after Hakluyt wrote this opinion, exploded this theory by showing that Oviedo,
in his genuine work, really gave 1527 as the date of the meeting of the English vessel, as
narrated. Biddle, however, still had faith in Eden’s statement that an expedition sailed
from England in the year indicated, commanded by Cabot and Pert, but held that it took
a northwesterly direction, and that it was on this expedition that Cabot entered Hudson
Bay, and reached the high latitude of 67½ N. as mentioned by him in a letter to Ramusio;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
in which letter Cabot says that “on the 11th of June, finding still the open sea without
any manner of impediment, he thought verily by that way to have passed on still the way
to Cathay, which is in the east, ... if the mutiny of the shipmaster and mariners had not
hindered him, and made him to return homewards from that place.” Biddle saw a parallel
in the language of Eden as to the “faint heart” of Pert, and in that of Cabot as to the “mutiny
of the shipmaster and mariners;” not forgetting also similar language in a letter written
by Robert Thorne to Doctor Ley, in 1527, relating to a voyage of discovery to the west,
in which Thorne’s father and another merchant of Bristol, Hugh Eliot, were participants&mdash;which
voyage, Mr. Biddle says, was in 1517&mdash;that, “if the mariners would then have
been ruled and followed their pilots’ mind, the lands of the West Indies, from whence all
the gold cometh, had been ours.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mr. Biddle forgets that in the letter of Cabot to
Ramusio, cited above, the writer says that the voyage of which he is here speaking was
made in the reign of Henry VII., who died in 1509, seven or eight years before the date
which Biddle assigns to the alleged Cabot and Pert voyage.</p>

<p>Dr. Kohl, who has very learnedly and at great length examined the claims for this
voyage of 1516-17,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> has little confidence that any such expedition actually sailed. Eden
says the voyage “took none effect,” which may mean that the expedition never sailed. It
seems also very improbable that Cabot, so recently domiciled in Spain, where he was
occupying an honorable position, should leave it all now and re-enter the service of England,
by whose Government he had apparently for so many years been neglected. No English
or Spanish writer mentions his leaving Spain at this time.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1555 there appeared in London the first collection in English of the “results of
that spirit of maritime enterprise which had been everywhere awakened by the discovery
of America.” The book was edited by Richard Eden,&mdash;just mentioned as the translator
of the fifth book of Munster, in 1553,&mdash;and consisted of translations from foreign writers,
principally Latin, Spanish, and Italian, of travels by sea and land, largely relating to discoveries
in the New World. The book was entitled, <i>The Decades of the Newe Worlde or West
India</i>, etc., inasmuch as one hundred and sixty-six folios out of three hundred and seventy-four,
which the book contains, consist of the first three Decades of Peter Martyr, and an
epitome of the fourth Decade first issued at Basle, in 1521. Then follow abstracts of Oviedo,
Gomara, Ramusio, Ziegler, Pigafeta, Munster, Bastaldus, Vespucius, and several others.
Some of the voyages are original and were drawn up by Eden’s own hand. It is a very
desirable book to possess; and though Eden was a clumsy editor, not always correct in
his translations, and did not always make it clear whether he or his author was speaking,
we are grateful to him for the book. An enthusiastic tribute is paid to Eden and his
book by Richard Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> who sets him off by an invidious comparison with Richard Hakluyt,
whom he studiously depreciates. Eden was apparently a devoted Catholic, and was
a spectator of the public entry of Philip and Mary into London in 1554. He says that the
splendid pageant as it passed before him inspired him to enter upon some work which he
might in due season offer as the result of his loyalty, and “crave for it the royal blessing.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In his preface to the reader Eden gives a brief review of ancient history, and coming down
to the time of the conquest of the Indies by Spain he eulogizes the conduct of that nation
towards the natives, particularly in having so effectually labored for their conversion. His
language is one continued eulogy of the Spaniards. He urges England to submit to
King Philip, of whom he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Of his behavior in England, his enemies (which canker virtue never lacked),&mdash;they, I say, if
any such yet remain,&mdash;have greatest cause to report well, yea so well, that if his natural clemency
were not greater than was their unnatural indignation, they know themselves what might have followed....
Being a lion he behaved himself as a lamb, and struck not his enemy having the sword
in his hand. Stoop, England, stoop, and learn to know thy lord and master, as horses and other
brute beasts are taught to do!”</p>

<p class="p1">He earnestly desires to see the Christian religion enlarged, and urges his countrymen
to follow here the example of the Spaniards in the New World. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am not able, with tongue or pen, to express what I conceive hereof in my mind, yet one
thing I see which enforseth me to speak, and lament that the harvest is so great and the workmen
so few. The Spaniards have showed a good example to all Christian nations to follow. But
as God is great and wonderful in all his works, so beside the portion of land pertaining to the
Spaniards (being eight times bigger than Italy, as you may read in the last book of the second
Decade), and beside that which pertaineth to the Portugals, there yet remaineth another portion of
that main land reaching toward the northeast, thought to be as large as the other, and not yet
known but only by the sea-coasts, neither inhabited by any Christian men; whereas, nevertheless,
(as writeth Gemma Phrisius) in this land there are many fair and fruitful regions, high mountains,
and fair rivers, with abundance of gold, and diverse kinds of beasts. Also cities and towers so
well builded, and people of such civility, that this part of the world seemeth little inferior to our
Europe, if the inhabitants had received our religion. They are witty people and refuse not bartering
with strangers. These regions are called Terra Florida and Regio Baccalearum or Bacchallaos,
of the which you may read somewhat in this book in the voyage of that worthy old man yet living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Sebastian Cabot, in the vi. book of the third Decade. But Cabot touched only in the north corner,
and most barbarous part thereof, from whence he was repulsed with ice in the month of July.
Nevertheless, the west and south parts of these regions have since been better searched by other,
and found to be as we have said before.... How much therefore is it to be lamented, and how
greatly doth it sound to the reproach of all Christendom, and especially to such as dwell nearest
to these lands (as we do), being much nearer unto the same than are the Spaniards (as within xxv
days sailing and less),&mdash;how much, I say, shall this sound unto our reproach and inexcusable slothfulness
and negligence, both before God and the world, that so large dominions of such tractable
people and pure gentiles, not being hitherto corrupted with any other false religion (and therefore
the easier to be allured to embrace ours), are now known unto us, and that we have no respect
neither for God’s cause nor for our own commodity, to attempt some voyages into these coasts, to
do for our parts as the Spaniards have done for theirs, and not ever like sheep to haunt one trade,
and to do nothing worthy memory among men or thanks before God, who may herein worthily accuse
us for the slackness of our duty toward him.”</p>

<p class="p1">The few voyages of discovery made by the English in the first part of the sixteenth
century, either by the authority of the Government or on private account, were productive
of little results; and when Sebastian Cabot finally returned to England from Spain, in
1547 or 1548, his influence was engaged by sundry merchants of London, who were seeking
to devise some means to check the decay of trade in the realm, by the discovery of a
new outlet for the manufactured products of the nation. The result was the sending off
the three vessels under Willoughby, in May, 1553, to the northeast, and finally the incorporation
of the merchant adventurers, with Cabot as governor.</p>

<p>In Richard Eden’s long address to the reader prefixed to his translation of the fifth
Book of Sebastian Münster, written probably before the Willoughby expedition had been
heard from, he speaks of “the attempt to pass to Cathay by the North East, which some
men doubt, as the globes represent it all land north, even to the north pole.” In his
preface to his <i>Decades</i>, cited above, written two years later, we have seen that he urges
the people of England to turn their attention in the old direction, and to take possession
of the waste places still unoccupied by any Christian people; which regions be says are
called Terra Florida and Regio Baccalearum. These offer a large opportunity for traffic
as a remedy for the stagnation of trade under which England is suffering, and a wide field
for the Christian missionary.</p>

<p>The reader will have noticed, in the above extract, that Eden says that Sebastian
Cabot “touched only in the north corner and most barbarous part” of the region which
he is urging his countrymen to take possession of, “from whence he was repulsed with
ice in the month of July.”</p>

<p>Eden’s <i>Decades</i> placed before the English reader for the first time the several notices
of Sebastian Cabot, of which mention has been here made; namely, by Martyr, Ramusio,
Gomara, and the brief Commentary by Ziegler. And the fact that this large unoccupied
territory at the west, which Eden here urges the English Government and people to take
possession of, was discovered by Cabot for the English nation, could not fail in time to
produce its fruit upon the English mind.</p>

<p>Sebastian Cabot, as we have seen, was living in England at the time Richard Eden published
his book, and a very old man. Eden appears to have been on terms of acquaintance
with him, if not of intimacy; and unless the infirmities of years weighed too heavily upon his
faculties, Cabot might have been able to impart much information to one so curious and eager
as Eden was to gather up details. Eden more than once speaks of what Sebastian Cabot
told him. In the margin of folio 255, where is a report of the famous conversation concerning
Sebastian Cabot, extracted from Ramusio, in which Cabot is spoken of as “a
Venetian born,” Eden says: “Sebastian Cabot told me that he was born in Brystowe,
and that at iiii years old he was carried with his father to Venice, and so returned again
into England with his father, after certain years, wherby he was thought to have been
born in Venice.” This was a bad beginning on the part of Eden as an interviewer; that
is to say, the truth was not reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Sebastian Cabot, if he had been asked, might have told Eden much more. Why did
not Eden hand in a list of questions? Why did he not submit to him a proof-sheet of the
story from Ramusio, which we know contains so many errors, and ask him to correct it,
so that the world might have a true account of the discovery of North America? What an
excellent opportunity was lost to Cabot for printing here under the auspices of Eden all
those maps and discourses which Hakluyt, at a later period, tells us were in the custody
of the worshipful Master William Worthington, who was very willing to have them overseen
and published, but which have never yet seen the light!<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>I have already called attention to the fact that Eden had a copy of Cabot’s map, and
translated one of the legends upon it,&mdash;that relating to the River La Plata, no. vii.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>About this time, or perhaps a few years earlier, there was painted in England a portrait
of Sebastian Cabot, supposed for many years to have been done by Holbein, whose death
has usually been referred to the year 1554, though recent investigations have rendered it
probable that he died eleven years before. The first notice of this portrait which I have
seen is in Purchas.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A minute description of it, with a notice of its disappearance from
Whitehall, where it hung for many years, is given by Mr. Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who subsequently purchased
the picture in England and brought it to this country, where in 1845 it was burned
with his house and contents, in Pittsburg, Pa. Two excellent copies of it, however, had
fortunately been taken, one of which, by the artist Chapman, is in the gallery of the Massachusetts
Historical Society,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the other in that of the New York Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The portrait was painted after Cabot had returned to England; and it is said, I know
not on what authority, to have been painted for King Edward VI., who died in 1553.
Cabot lived some five years longer. The picture represents Cabot as a very old man. It
has the following inscription upon it:<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6 p1"><span class="smcap">Effigies· Sebastiani Caboti<br />
Angli· Filii· Johãnis· Caboti· Vene<br />
Ti· Militis· Avrati· Primi· Invēt<br />
Oris· Terræ Noviæ Sub Herico Vii. Angl</span></p>
<p class="pp7"><span class="smcap">Læ Rege.</span></p>

<p class="p1">A peculiar interest is attached to this inscription, from the circumstance that it must
probably have proceeded from Sebastian Cabot himself; that is to say, the facts intended
to be embodied in it by the artist or herald could best come from him. But being clumsily
expressed, it is uncertain whether the son or the father was intended to be represented as the
knight and discoverer. With the exception of the legend on the map already mentioned,
it is the only direct testimony presumably from Sebastian himself as to the principal fact
involved. That joins both the father and the son as discoverers. Here the honor is given
to but one of them, but unhappily the only statement clearly expressed is that Sebastian
Cabot is an Englishman and the son of John Cabot, a Venetian. Which was the knight
and the discoverer no one can tell certainly from the legend itself. The inscription has
been the subject of considerable discussion and even controversy.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Humboldt has a
brief note on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in which he says: “Il importe de savoir si c’est le père Jean ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
le fils Sebastien qui est désigné comme celui auquel la décoverte est due. Si c’était le
fils, Holbein aurait probablement placé le mot <i>filii</i> après <i>Veneti</i>. Il aurait écrit: <i>Effigies</i>
Seb. Caboti Angli, Joannis Caboti Veneti filii....” We now know from other evidence
that John Cabot was the discoverer of North America. He may have been accompanied
by his son, Sebastian, but it would have been a pleasant fact to have the testimony of the
son to his father’s honor clearly expressed, as may have been intended in this awkward
composition. Sebastian Cabot has been the sphinx of American history for over three
hundred years, and this inscription over his head in his picture does not tend to divest him
of that character. There has as yet appeared no other evidence to show that either John
Cabot or Sebastian was ever knighted. Purchas<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> insists on giving the title of “Sir” to
the son. Laying aside the question as to the interpretation of the inscription on the portrait,
there is sufficient evidence elsewhere to show that Sebastian Cabot was not a knight.
In two documents to be more particularly noticed in another place,&mdash;one dated in May,
1555, and the other in May, 1557, the latter dated not long before Sebastian Cabot’s
death,&mdash;relating to a pension granted to him by the Crown of England, he is styled
“Armiger,” a dignity below that of knight and equivalent to that of esquire. See
Rymer’s <i>Fœdera</i>, vol. xv. pp. 427 and 466.</p>

<p>In 1558 there was published in Paris a book entitled <i>Les Singularitez de la France
Antarcktique</i>, etc., by F. André Thevet, the French Cosmographer.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This writer is held in
little estimation, and deservedly so. In chapter lxxiv. fol. 145, <i>verso</i>, in speaking of the
Baccalaos, is this passage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It was first discovered by Sebastian Babate, an Englishman, who persuaded Henry VII., King
of England, that he could go easily this way by the North to Cathay, and that he would thus obtain
spices and other articles from the Indies equally as well as the King of Portugal; added to which
he proposed to go to Peru and America, to people the country with new inhabitants, and to establish
there a New England, which he did not accomplish. True it is he put three hundred men
ashore, somewhere to the north of Ireland, where the cold destroyed nearly the whole company,
though it was then the month of July. Afterwards Jaques Cartier (as he himself has told me)
made two voyages to that country in 1534 and 1535.”</p>

<p class="p1">This passage it will be seen is a mere perversion of that in Gomara, changing the name
of Cabot to Babate, and Iceland to Ireland, but adding the wholly unauthorized statement
that the three hundred men were put ashore and perished in the cold. Mr. Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> who
calls attention to this writer’s recklessness, says that this is a “random addition suggested
by the reference in Gomara to one of the objects of Cabot’s expedition, and the reasons
which compelled him to turn back.” On the other hand, he thinks it possible that Thevet
“derived his information from Cartier, who would be very likely to know of any such attempt
at settlement.” It is not at all likely that Thevet had any authority whatever for his
statement. His mention of Cartier is probably suggested by seeing in Gomara,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> immediately
following the extract from him above quoted, the mention of Cartier as being on that
coast in 1534 and 1535. But Thevet’s statement has entered into sober history, and has
been quoted and requoted.</p>

<p>Captain Antonio Galvano, the Portuguese, had died in 1557, leaving behind him a <i>Trádado</i>,
a historical treatise, which was published at Lisbon in 1563. It gives an account “of
all the discoveries, ancient and modern, which have been made up to the year one thousand
five hundred and fifty.” This is a valuable chronological list of discoveries in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
writer includes, in the latter part, his own experience. He spent the early part of his life in
India, and the latter part, on being recalled home, in compiling an account of all known
voyages. The Hakluyt Society have published Galvano’s book in the original, from a
copy, believed to be unique, in the Carter-Brown Library, at Providence R. I. It is
accompanied by an English version, by an unknown translator, long in the possession
of Hakluyt, corrected and published by him, as the title says, in 1601.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Hakluyt never
could get sight of a copy of the original edition. On comparing the texts, several omissions
and additions are noticed by the modern editor. The former are supposed to be due
to the inadvertence of the translator, the latter to Hakluyt, who supplied what he thought
important from other sources; and to him are probably due the marginal references.
The following is the English version of Galvano’s account<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of Cabot’s discovery, some
omissions having been supplied by the modern editor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the year 1496 there was a Venetian in England called John Cabota, who having knowledge
of such a new discovery as this was [viz. the discovery by Columbus], and perceiving by the globe
that the islands before spoken of stood almost in the same latitude with his country, and much
nearer to England than to Portugal, or to Castile, he acquainted King Henry the Seventh, then
King of England, with the same, wherewith the said king was greatly pleased, and furnished him
out with two ships and three hundred men; which departed and set sail in the spring of the year,
and they sailed westward till they came in sight of land in 45 degrees of latitude towards the north,
and then went straight northwards till they came into 60 degrees of latitude, where the day is eighteen
hours long, and the night is very clear and bright. There they found the air cold, and great
islands of ice, but no ground in seventy, eighty, an hundred fathoms sounding, but found much ice,
which alarmed them; and so from thence putting about, finding the land to turn eastwards, they
trended along by it on the other tack, discovering all the bay and river<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> named Deseado, to see if
it passed on the other side; then they sailed back again, diminishing the latitude, till they came to
38 degrees toward the equinoctial line, and from thence returned into England. There be others
which say that he went as far as the Cape of Florida, which standeth in 25 degrees.”</p>

<p class="p1">It will be seen that the greater part of this is taken from Gomara, and the writer had
also read Peter Martyr and Ramusio, and from the latter takes his year 1496. One statement,&mdash;namely,
that Cabot came in sight of land in 45 degrees north,&mdash;is original here,
which would almost lead one to suppose that Galvano had seen the <i>prima vista</i> of Cabot’s
map.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, near the beginning of the extract from Galvano, that John Cabot is
said to be the discoverer. Thus it stands in the old English version as published by Hakluyt,
but in the original Portuguese it reads: “No anno de 1496 achandose hum Venezeano
por nome Sebastiāo Gaboto em Inglaterra,” etc. The substitution of John for Sebastian
was no doubt due to Hakluyt, who also made this marginal note: “The great discovery of
John Cabota and the English.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In this same year (1563) there was published in London an English version from the
French of Jean Ribault, entitled, <i>The whole and True discoverie of Terra Florida</i> (<i>englished
the Flourishing Lande</i>), etc., giving an account of the attempt to found a colony at
Port Royal in the preceding year. The translation was made by Thomas Hacket, and
was reprinted by Richard Hakluyt in his <i>Divers Voyages</i>, in 1582.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In referring to the
preceding attempts at discovery and settlement of those northern shores, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Of the which there was one, a very famous stranger named Sebastian Cabota, an excellent
pilot, sent thither by King Henry, the year 1498, and many others, who never could attain to any
habitation, nor take possession thereof one only foot of ground, nor yet approach or enter into
these parts and fair rivers into the which God hath brought us.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p class="p1">This passage from Ribault is cited principally for the date there given, 1498, as the
year of Sebastian Cabot’s visit to the northern shores. It was not the year of the discovery,
but was the year of the second voyage. Where did Ribault pick up this date?
No one of the notices of Cabot’s voyage hitherto cited contains it. I have already called
attention to Peter Martyr’s language, in 1524, that Sebastian Cabot discovered the Baccalaos
twenty-six years before, from which by a calculation that date is arrived at.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In 1570 Abraham Ortelius published at Antwerp the first edition of his celebrated
<i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i>, containing fifty-three copperplate maps, engraved by Hogenberg.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
In the beginning of the book is a list of the maps which Ortelius had consulted,
and he mentions among them one by “Sebastianus Cabotus Venetus, Universalem Tabulam:
quam impressam æneis formis vidimus, sed sine nomine loci et impressoris.” This
would seem to describe, so far as it goes, the Cabot map in the National Library, at Paris,
which is a large engraved map of the world, “without the name of the place or the printer.”</p>

<p>Mr. Biddle was impressed with the belief that Ortelius was largely influenced in the
composition of his map by the map of Cabot. He contended that Cabot’s landfall was the
coast of Labrador, and he found near that coast, on the map of Ortelius, a small island
named St. John, which he supposed was that discovered by Cabot on St. John’s day and
so named, and was taken by Ortelius from Cabot’s map.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But an examination of the
Paris map fails to confirm Biddle’s hypothesis. The “Y. de s. Juan,” is in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence near where the <i>prima vista</i> is placed. A delineation of what might be
called Hudson Bay appears on the map of Ortelius, and Biddle supposed that Cabot’s
map furnished the authority for it. But no such representation of that bay appears
on Cabot’s map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1574 there appeared at Cologne another edition of Peter Martyr’s three Decades,
published in connection with some writings of the distinguished Fleming, Damiani A.
Goès.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The third Decade of Martyr, as I have already said, contained the earliest notice
of Sebastian Cabot.</p>

<p class="p2">We have arrived at a period now when the public men of England began especially to
interest themselves in voyages of discovery and colonization, and successfully to engage
the good offices of the Queen in their behalf. “There hath been two special causes in
former age,” says George Beste in “the Epistle Dedicatory” to his voyages of Frobisher,
published in 1578, “that have greatly hindered the English nation in their attempts. The
one hath been lack of liberality in the nobility; and the other, want of skill in the cosmography
and the art of navigation,&mdash;which kind of knowledge is very necessary for all
our noblemen, for that, we being islanders, our chiefest strength consisteth by sea. But
these two causes are now in this present age (God be thanked!) very well reformed; for
not only her Majesty now, but all the nobility also, having perfect knowledge in cosmography,
do not only with good words countenance the forward minds of men, but also with
their purses do liberally and bountifully contribute unto the same; whereby it cometh to
pass that navigation, which in the time of King Henry VII. was very raw, and took (as
it were) but beginning (and ever since hath had by little and little continual increase), is
now in her Majesty’s reign grown to his highest perfection.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Frobisher sailed on his first voyage in June, 1576. The tract of Sir Humphrey Gilbert,
entitled, <i>A Discourse of Discovery for a new Passage to Cataia</i>, principally written ten
years before, was published before Frobisher left the Thames. The reference in this
tract to Sebastian Cabot&mdash;who “by his personal experience and travel hath set forth and
described this passage [that is, the Straits of Anian] in his charts, which are yet to be
seen in the Queen’s Majesty’s Privy Gallery at Whitehall, who was sent to make this discovery
by King Henry VII., and entered the same fret,” etc.&mdash;has led Mr. Biddle to
suppose that Frobisher had the benefit of Cabot’s experience, and that his maps or charts
hanging in the gallery at Whitehall had delineated on them the strait or passage through
to the Pacific, which Cabot entered, and would have passed on to Cathay, if he had not
been prevented by the mutiny of the master and mariners.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>One would naturally infer that Gilbert wrote this passage after inspecting the map in
Whitehall, but the full passage of which we have here given an extract is taken from
Cabot’s letter in Ramusio,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to which work Gilbert refers in the margin of his tract thus:
“Written in the Discourses of Navigation.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I may add that in the following year, 1577,
Richard Willes published a new edition of Eden,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> containing all the references to Cabot
in the genuine edition, and also a paper on Frobisher’s first voyage, with some speculations,
added to those of Gilbert, as to the northwest passage. In this paper, addressed to the
Countess of Warwick, he makes frequent reference to Cabot’s card or table, in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the countess’s father “at Cheynies,” as proving by Cabot’s experience the existence of
such a strait as had been spoken of by Gilbert, and of which Frobisher in his first voyage
was in search. He says: “Cabota was not only a skilful seaman but a long traveller, and
such a one as entered personally that strait, sent by King Henry VII. to make this aforesaid
discovery, as in his own discourse of navigation you may read in his card drawn with
his own hand; the mouth of the northwest strait lieth near the 318 meridian, betwixt 61
and 64 degrees in elevation, continuing the same breadth about 10 degrees west, where it
openeth southerly more and more.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>If the Countess of Warwick’s father, the Earl of Bedford, had a map by Cabot, with a
northwestern strait delineated on it in degrees of latitude and longitude as described
by Willes, it could not be a copy of the recently recovered Paris map. In the latter
the coast to the north of Labrador from latitude 58 to 65 runs in a northeasterly direction,
when it suddenly trends in a northwesterly direction, its delineation ceasing at latitude
68, where is this inscription, “Costa del hues norueste” (coast west-northwest). Dr.
Kohl is of opinion that Cabot is here delineating, from his own experience, Cumberland
Island in Davis’s Strait; but Mr. Biddle thinks that Cabot’s highest northern latitude
was reached in Fox’s Channel on the shores of Melville Peninsula. All these speculations
seem to me to be based on very uncertain data.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>One is impressed with the ambiguous language of Willes when he speaks of Cabot’s
“own discourse of navigation [which] you may read in his card drawn by his own hand.”
The phrase “discourse of navigation” sounds so much like Gilbert’s reference in the
margin of his tract to Ramusio, that I am disposed to refer it to that source.</p>

<p>Clement Adams, as we shall see farther on, made a copy of Cabot’s map or a copy of
some reputed map of Cabot, in 1549 (if the supposition as to the date is correct), which
in Hakluyt’s time hung in the gallery at Whitehall, and of which copies were also to be
seen in many merchants’ houses; yet it is difficult to understand how different copies of
a genuine map of Cabot could contain such variations. Certainly they are all unsatisfactory,
and throw but little light on the voyage of the Cabots.</p>

<p>The indefatigable compiler and translator Belleforest issued in 1576,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in Paris, his <i>Cosmographie
Universelle</i>, on the basis of the work of Sebastian Munster; and he says<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that
Sebastian Cabot attempted, at the expense of Henry VII. of England, to find the way
to Cathay by the north; that he discovered the point of Baccalaos, which the Breton and
Norman sailors now call the Coast of Codfish, and proceeding yet farther reached the
latitude of 67 degrees towards the Arctic pole. Substantially the same passage may be
found in Chauveton’s <i>Histoire Nouvelle du Nouveau Monde</i>, p. 141, published at Geneva,
in 1579, being a translation of Benzoni, and of other writers.</p>

<p>In connection with Frobisher’s voyage there was published in London, in 1578, <i>A
Prayse and Report of Maister Martyne Frobisher’s Voyage to Meta Incognita</i>, by
Thomas Churchyard, a miscellaneous and voluminous writer, who says: “I find that
Cabota was the first in King Henry VII.’s days that diserned this frozen land or seas
from 67 towards the north, from thence toward the south along the coast to 36 degrees.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The work of George Beste, the writer of the account of Frobisher’s three voyages,
before mentioned, published in London in 1578, speaks of Sebastian Cabot as having discovered
sundry parts of new-found-land, and attempted the passage to Cathay, and as
being an Englishman, born in Bristowe. And a yet further reference is made to him,
with the singular additional statement that the date of his discovery was 1508. This
date may be a clerical or typographical error.</p>

<p>These brief notices of Sebastian Cabot are cited as showing how a tradition is kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
alive by one author or compiler quoting another, neither of which is of the slightest
authority in itself.</p>

<p>In 1582 there appeared at Paris a work entitled <i>Les Trois Mondes</i>, etc. by L. V.
Popellinière. It is a mere compilation, and embraces translations from various authors
relating to the discoveries of the different maritime nations of Europe in various parts of
the world. His third world is Australia, called by the Spaniards, he says, Terra del Fuego,
which is here represented on a map as a large continent.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> On fol. 25 it is said that Cabot
was the first to conduct the English to the Baccalaos, which was better known to him
than to any other; that he armed two ships at the charge and with the consent of Henry
VII. of England to go there, and took out with him three hundred Englishmen, and
sailed along 48½ degrees in a strait, but was so baffled by the extremity of the cold which
he found there in July, that, although the days were long, and the nights were clear, he
did not dare to pass beyond with his men to the island to which he wished to conduct
them.</p>

<p>This is substantially a resumé of the account in Gomara, with a discrepancy in stating
the latitude reached.</p>

<p>Following a long resumé in French of the conversation in the first volume of Ramusio,
this writer remarks: “This then was that Gabote which first discovered Florida
for the King of England, so that the Englishmen have more right thereunto than the
Spaniards; if to have right unto a country, it sufficeth to have first seen and discovered
the same.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In 1580 was published the first edition of Stow’s <i>Chronicle</i> (or <i>Annals</i>) <i>of England</i>,
etc., which contains, under the year 1498, the alleged passage from Fabian, which Mr.
Biddle<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> charges Hakluyt with perverting, by prefixing in his larger work the name of
John Cabot to the “Venitian” as it appeared in the <i>Divers Voyages</i> of 1582. The
passage in Stow begins thus: “This year one Sebastian Gabato, a Genoa’s son, born in
Bristow,” etc. Reference will be made to this document farther on.</p>

<p>In 1582 Richard Hakluyt published his <i>Divers Voyages</i>, his first book, which contains
many curious and important documents. It is dedicated to Master Philip Sidney, Esquire,
who, with other statesmen and public men of England, was then deeply interested in
American Colonization, being largely inspired by political considerations. The dedication
contains an interesting summary of what had been done by other nations, and the reasons
why England should now enter upon this work. Reasons are also given for believing that
“there is a strait and short way open into the west even unto Cathay,” which they had so
long desired to find. And finally the claim of England to the large unsettled territory in
America is set forth, “from Florida to sixty-seven degrees northward, by the letters
patent granted to John Gabote and his three sons, Lewis, Sebastian, and Santius, with
Sebastian’s own certificate to Baptista Ramusius of his discovery of America, and the
testimony of Fabian our own chronicler.”</p>

<p>We begin now to approach for the first time a document which is of the highest
authenticity and value. I mean the letters patent, which Hakluyt here prints,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which the discovery of North America was made by authority of England. John Cabot,
the father, now emerges from obscurity, for we find the grant is to him and to his three
sons, of whom Sebastian is the second. The patent gave them permission to sail with
five ships, at their own costs and charges, under the royal banners and ensigns, to all
countries and seas of the east, of the west, and of the north, and to seek out and discover
whatsoever isles, countries, and provinces of the heathen and infidels, whatsoever they be,
which before this time had been unknown to Christians. They also had license to set up
the royal banners in the countries found by them, and to conquer and possess them as the
king’s vassals and lieutenants. This document is dated 5 March, 1495 (that is 1496, new
style). Hakluyt also prints an extract from Fabian’s chronicle, furnished him by John
Stow, and supposed to have been in manuscript, as it is not contained in any printed
edition of Fabian. In the heading which Hakluyt gives to the paper as printed, he says
it is “a note of Sebastian Gabote’s voyage of discovery.” The document reads: “This
year the King (by means of a Venetian which made himself very expert and cunning in
knowledge of the circuit of the world and islands of the same, ...) caused to man and
victual a ship at Bristowe to search for an island which, he said he knew well, was rich and
replenished with rich commodities,&mdash;which ship thus manned and victualed at the King’s
cost, divers merchants of London ventured in her small stocks, being in her as chief
patron the said Venetian. And in the company of the said ship sailed also out of Bristowe
three or four small ships fraught with slight and gross merchandizes; ... and so departed
from Bristowe in the beginning of May, of whom in this Mayor’s time returned no tidings.”
This of course refers to the voyage of 1498.</p>

<p>In the margin against this paper Hakluyt has this note: “In the 13 year of King
Henry the VII., 1498,” and also “William Purchas, Mayor of London,” whose time expired
the last of October, 1498. Stow, as has been seen, had already printed this paper, two
years before, in his <i>Annals</i>; and it is reprinted in later editions of that work. What precise
shape the original paper was in, which was used by Stow and Hakluyt, we do not
know. If they had but one original it was not followed in all its details by both. Dr.
E. E. Hale printed in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the American Antiquarian Society for October,
1865, a paper from the Cotton manuscripts in the British Museum, Vitellius, A. xvi, which
he thought was the original paper used by each, and to which Hakluyt’s copy conforms
more nearly than does that of Stow. The Cotton manuscript gives no name to the
navigator, but calls him a stranger “Venetian,” as does Hakluyt. Stow, who probably
rarely heard of the name of John Cabot, and was very familiar with that of Sebastian,
calls him “Sebastian Gaboto, a Genoa’s son.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Hakluyt also prints in this precious little volume the substance of Sebastian Cabot’s
letter to Ramusio, printed in the beginning of his third volume, in which he mentions the
degree of latitude, 67½° N., which Cabot reached in his voyage in search of a way to
Cathay.</p>

<p>He also prints for the first time the two well-known letters of Robert Thorne, in the
latter of which, addressed to Dr. Ley, the English ambassador to Spain, the writer says
that his father and another merchant of Bristol, Hugh Eliot, were the discoverers of the
new-found lands. Some have conjectured that these merchants went out with the Cabots,
and others that they were in some later expedition not well defined. Hakluyt also prints
here an English version of “Verarzanus,” and Hacket’s “Ribault.” The volume also contains
two maps, one of which, prepared by Michael Locke, was made, he says, “according
to Verarzanus’s plat,” an “old excellent map, which he gave to King Henry VIII., and is yet
in the custody of Master Locke.” The map of Locke was probably made only in its general
features according to the original model, and contained some more modern additions
by its compiler. It has one interesting inscription upon it,&mdash;namely, on the delineation
of C. Breton we read, “J. Gabot, 1497.” This is the first time I have seen this date
assigned as the date of the discovery.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Hakluyt’s little volume expressed the interest felt in England on the subject of North
American colonization, and furnished the ground on which England based her title to the
country. He also announced in this book that Sebastian Cabot’s maps and discourses
were then in the custody of one of Cabot’s old associates, William Worthington, who was
willing to have them seen and published.</p>

<p class="p2">The interest in the contemplated voyage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who made
the first serious attempt in that century at colonization for England, culminated next
year, when he sailed and never returned. Among the reports of that voyage was one
written by Mr. Edward Haies in 1583, in which he says: “The first discovery of
these coasts (never heard of before) was well begun by John Cabot the father,
and Sebastian the son, an Englishman born, who were the first finders out of all that
great tract of land stretching from the Cape of Florida unto those islands which we
now call the Newfoundland; all which they brought and annexed unto the crown of
England.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Sir George Peckham, a large adventurer with Gilbert, also wrote in 1583 on the same
theme, and he makes mention of the title of England in the following language: “In the
time of the Queen’s grandfather of worthy memory, King Henry VII., letters patent were
by his Majesty granted to John Cabota, an Italian, to Lewis, Sebastian, and Sancius, his
three sons, to discover remote, barbarous, and heathen countries, which discovery was
afterwards executed to the use of the Crown of England in the said King’s time by Sebastian
and Sancius, his sons, who were born here in England.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It seems to have been
thought that the title of England would be strengthened by the statement that the discoverers,
or some of them, were native subjects of the Crown of England. This seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have been one reason why it has always been insisted on that Sebastian Cabot, so long
supposed to be the discoverer, was born in England.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>I have already spoken of an edition of Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i> in the original Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<i>De Orbe Novo</i>, published at Paris in 1587, under the editorship of Richard Hakluyt, who
was then residing in that city in connection with the British Embassy. It was dedicated
to Sir Walter Raleigh, for whom, three years before, Hakluyt had written the <i>Discourse on
Westerne Planting</i>. It was the first time the <i>Decades</i> had been printed entire since the
first edition of them appeared at Alcala in Spain in 1530. It has been suggested by Mr.
Brevoort that the Spanish Government did not favor their circulation, or encourage their
republication. In Hakluyt’s edition there was inserted an excellent map of North and
South America, of small size, six and a half by seven and a half inches, and dedicated to
him by the maker, “F. G.” On the delineation of the coast of Labrador, there is inscribed
just north of the River St. Lawrence, “Baccalaos Ab Anglis, 1496.” This date was
without doubt supplied by Hakluyt himself, who, in his <i>Discourse on Westerne Planting</i>,
insisted on that erroneous date as the true year of discovery,&mdash;citing the conversation in
the first volume of Ramusio for his authority, as we have seen.</p>

<p>In tracing down the notices in print of John or Sebastian Cabot, we come now to a
book of considerable interest, published in Venice in 1588, some years after the death of
its author, Livio Sanuto. It was entitled <i>Geographica Distincta</i>, etc., and related in part
to matters connected with naval science. The author was deeply interested in the subject
of the variation of the needle, and having heard that Sebastian Cabot had publicly explained
this subject to the King of England (supposed to be Edward VI., on Cabot’s
return to England), he applied to the Venetian ambassador there resident to ascertain
from Cabot himself where he had fixed the point of no variation. The information was
accordingly procured and published by Sanuto. In the course of his investigations the
author made use of a map composed by Cabot himself, in which the position of this meridian
was seen to be one hundred and ten miles to the west of the island of Flores, one of
the Azores. Mr. Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who dwells at some length on this volume, calls attention to the
fact “that the First Meridian on the maps of Mercator, running through the most western
point of the Azores, was adopted with reference to the supposed coincidence in that quarter
of the true and magnetic poles.” Sanuto makes frequent reference to the map of Cabot
in his book, and also makes mention of Cabot’s observations relating to the variation of the
compass at the equator. I have already called attention to one of the legends on Cabot’s
map of 1544, no. 17, which relates in part to the variation of the needle. In <i>Prima
Parte</i>, lib. ii. fol. 17, Sanuto gives a brief account of Cabot’s voyage, which Mr. Biddle<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
says corresponds minutely with that which Sir Humphrey Gilbert derived from the map
hung up in Queen Elizabeth’s gallery. Sanuto, however, evidently copied from Cabot’s
letter in the preface of the third volume of Ramusio, from which also the language in
Gilbert is drawn.</p>

<p>In 1589 Hakluyt published his first folio of 825 pages entitled, <i>The Principal Navigations,
Voyages, and Discoveries of the English Nation</i>, a monument of his industry as a
collector. In this first folio Hakluyt included several pieces from his little quarto tract
of 1582, and he collected and put into English other most important evidence relating
to the discovery of North America by the Cabots. He gave the passage in Peter Martyr,
the conversation in Ramusio, the extract from Gomara, added to those documents reprinted
from the quarto tract, all of which have been here noticed in the order in which
they appeared in print. It may be added that in the passage from Fabian Hakluyt introduced
the name of John Cabot as the Venetian, though he allowed the name of Sebastian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to stand in the heading, probably through inadvertence. He also brought the marginal
date into the text.</p>

<p class="p1">He also produced here from the Rolls Office a memorandum of a license granted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
King to John Cabot alone, to take five English ships of two hundred tons or under, with
necessary furniture, and mariners and subjects of the King as would willingly go with
him,&mdash;dated the 3d day of February in the thirteenth year of his reign (1497/8).</p>

<p>The full copy of this license Hakluyt probably never saw, and the significance of this
brief memorandum was never known until, two hundred and forty years afterwards, the
entire document was found and published by Mr. Richard Biddle in his <i>Memoir of Sebastian
Cabot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It was therefore often interpreted, in connection with the letters patent previously
issued, as a grant to take up ships for the first voyage, which, as was supposed,
did not take place till 1498.</p>

<p>The original grant of this license, of which Hakluyt publishes a brief memorandum, is
found to be a permit to enlist ships and mariners, etc., “and them convey and lead <i>to the
land and isles of late found by the said John in our name and by our commandment</i>.
Paying for them and every of them as and if we should in or for our own cause pay, and
none otherwise.”</p>

<p>The part I have italicized is most significant, and shows that a previous voyage had
been made by John Cabot under the authority of the Crown.</p>

<p>Hakluyt also reprinted for the first time, in Latin, with an English version, an extract
from Sebastian Cabot’s map, being no. 8 of the Legends inscribed upon it, relating to the
discovery of North America, already recited on p. 21. And in saying that it was taken
from Sebastian Cabot’s map, I should explain that Hakluyt says it was “an extract taken
out of the map of Sebastian Cabot, cut by Clement Adams, ... which is to be seen in
her Majesty’s Privy Gallery at Westminster, and in many other ancient merchants’
houses.” This language is a little equivocal, and some have supposed that Hakluyt
intended to say that the extract simply was cut by Adams, and not that the whole map
was copied by him. Clement Adams was a schoolmaster and a learned man, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was not an engraver. But Hakluyt is elsewhere more explicit. In his <i>Westerne
Planting</i>,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> he says: “His [Cabot’s] own map is in the Queen’s Privy Gallery at Westminster,
the copy whereof was set out by Mr. Clement Adams, and is in many merchants’
houses in London.” It was probably reproduced under the inspection of Adams.
We do not know the year in which Adams’s copy was made, unless an equivocal date
in the margin of Purchas<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> may be regarded as expressing the year, namely “1549.”
Purchas has fallen into great confusion in attempting to describe Cabot’s map and his
picture as they hung in Whitehall in his time.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>All these documents relative to the Cabot voyages were reprinted by Hakluyt in the
third volume of his larger work&mdash;bearing a similar general title to that of 1589&mdash;published
in 1600.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In the extract from Cabot’s map, cut by Clement Adams, there reproduced,
he changed the date of the year of the discovery from 1494 to 1497. This latter is
no doubt the true date, but on what authority did Hakluyt make the change? M. D’Avezac,
who contended that 1494 was the true date of the discovery, that being the date on Cabot’s
map, believed that the change was the result of a typographical error.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> That it was deliberate
and that the change was not made by an error of the printer, is shown by the fact
that the altered date appears both in the Latin extract and the English version of it; and
that the index or general catalogue at the beginning of the third volume, in noticing the
authorities for Sebastian Cabot’s voyage, gives “1497” as the year. Again, a copy of
Emeric Molyneaux’s map, prepared about this time, and inserted in some copies of this
volume of Hakluyt, has on the delineation of Labrador, which some suppose to have been
the <i>prima vista</i> of Cabot, the following inscription: “This land was discovered by John and
Sebastian Cabot for King Henry VII., 1497.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> I have already referred to the earliest use
of this date as the year of the discovery, inscribed on a map of Locke in Hakluyt’s <i>Divers
Voyages</i> of 1582. But the true source of the date is not here revealed.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Clement Adams’s map is yet a mystery. I have already called attention to two editions
of Cabot’s map, one of which is in the National Library at Paris, and another from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which the legends in Chytræus were copied. The extract from Adams’s edition, first
made by Hakluyt in 1589,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> was in Latin, but from a text quite different from that of Chytræus,
or from the Paris map. It is Legend No. 8 of the inscriptions, and was the “Chapiter
of Gabot’s mapp <i>De terra nova</i>,” as set out by Adams, which Hakluyt tells us of in his
<i>Discourse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This heading is the same as that in Chytræus. Here we have two different
translations from a Spanish original. Did Adams transcribe from another copy of Cabot’s
map yet to be discovered&mdash;for we can hardly suppose he would make a new Latin version
of the legends, with one already before him&mdash;or did he translate from a map with the
Spanish legends only?&mdash;neither of which precious documents is to be found in our
bureaus of cartography, and they are yet to be added to Dr. Kohl’s list of lost maps!</p>

<p>Following Hakluyt’s extract from Adams’s map is an English version by him, beginning
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the year of our Lord 1494, John Cabot, a Venetian, and his son Sebastian (with an English
fleet set out from Bristol), discovered that land which no man before that time had attempted,
on the 24th of June, about five of o’clock early in the morning. This land he called Prima vista, that
is to say, First seen, because, as <i>I suppose</i>, it was that part whereof they had the first sight from sea.
That island which lyeth out before the land he called the Island of S. John, upon this occasion,
as <i>I think</i>, because it was discovered upon the day of St. John the Baptist.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is scarcely necessary to say that the passage in parenthesis is not in the original,
but is introduced by Hakluyt. But the words which I have italicized are represented in
the extract by “credo” and “opinor,” and are not authorized by the language of the Paris
map, nor by the same legend in Chytræus. In the concluding part of this extract, not
here quoted, Hakluyt speaks of a certain kind of fish seen by the Cabots, “which the
<i>Savages</i> call Baccalaos.” The Latin of Adams’s map and of the Paris map is <i>vulgus</i>,
which may mean the common people of Europe, or the fishermen. In the Spanish of the
Paris map, it is said that the fish are called Baccalaos, but it does not say by whom.
The “white bears” of the Spanish crept into the Latin of Adams, and of course into
Hakluyt’s English, as “white lions.”</p>

<p>An interesting discussion as to the authenticity of this map of Cabot in the Paris
Library, in connection with the genuineness of the date 1494, as expressing the true year
of the discovery of North America, may be seen in the letter of M. D’Avezac to President
Woods, already referred to. M. D’Avezac accepts the map and the date as genuine and
authentic, while Dr. Kohl rejects both. Mr. Richard Henry Major, in his paper on “The
True Date of the English Discovery,” etc., ably reviews the whole question discussed by
those distinguished <i>savans</i>, and adopts a somewhat modified view. He believes that
Sebastian Cabot originally drew a map with <i>legends</i> or inscriptions upon it in Spanish
only, but that he had no hand in publishing it, or in correcting it for the press, and that
the errors in the engraved map arose from the ignorance or inadvertence of transcribers;
that the date of the discovery, 1497, was expressed in Roman numerals in the manuscript;
that the letter V. in the numerals VII. was carelessly drawn, and not well joined at the
base, so that a reader might well take it for a II.; and that such an error might more
easily occur in a manuscript, especially on parchment, than on an engraved map on paper.
As evidence that the Paris map, which Dr. Kohl thinks was made in Germany or Belgium,
was copied from a Spanish manuscript, Mr. Major cites the instance of the name Laguna
de Nicaragua being rendered into “Laguna de Nicaxagoe.” The Spanish manuscript <i>r</i>
being in the form of our northern x, the transcriber showed his ignorance by substituting
the one letter for the other. So also as regards the copy made by Clement Adams from
the Spanish original. He made an independent translation of the inscriptions into Latin,
which accounts for the two Latin versions, and also made the same error for the same
reason, in giving the date 1494, instead of 1497.</p>

<p>Mr. Major believes that Hakluyt had good reason for making the change of date from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1494 to 1497 as the true date of discovery, as in the same volume in which the change
was made he introduced the remarkable map of Molyneaux, referred to above, on which
that date was inscribed as the year of the discovery; and furthermore that he may have
consulted the papers of Cabot in the possession of William Worthington.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="p2">To return again from this long digression to the volumes of Hakluyt in which he has
brought together his various authorities relating to the voyages of the Cabots, one is
impressed with a feeling of disappointment that he makes no attempt to reconcile their apparent
glaring discrepancies,&mdash;that is to say, as to the different dates given in them to the
voyage of discovery, and the variation in the different degrees of latitude reached; while
no opinion is expressed as to the comparative agency of John or Sebastian Cabot, or the
question as to whether there was more than one voyage,&mdash;I mean a second immediately
following the first which was of discovery. In the general catalogue prefixed in 1600 to
the third volume of his larger work, he refers to these several “testimonies” as proving a
voyage of discovery in 1497, while in reality no one of them proves that date, bearing in
mind that the date in the extract from Adams’s map was in this later reprint inserted by
him on some evidence not found in his volumes,&mdash;the truth being that all these testimonies,
taken as a whole, refer probably to two if not three voyages, as we have already
seen.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>I do not forget that these volumes of Hakluyt contain other interesting documents relating
to Cabot,&mdash;namely, the record of the pension granted by Edward VI., dated Jan. 6,
1548-49, of £165 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, to date from the preceding Michaelmas Day (September 29);
the Ordinances and Instructions compiled by Cabot for the intended voyage for Cathay,
May 9, 1553; his appointment in the charter of the Muscovy Company, Feb. 6, 1555-56,
as its governor; the story of his presence on board the “Serchthrift” at Gravesend on
the 13th of April, 1556, about to sail on a voyage of discovery to the northeast, where
the venerable man “entered into the dance himself.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>I have already referred to a volume of Chytræus, containing the Latin legends on
Sebastian Cabot’s map, which was published about this time,&mdash;the first edition in 1594,
a second in 1599, and a third edition in 1606. We can hardly suppose that Hakluyt
ever saw this book, at least in the earlier editions, as he could hardly have failed to incorporate
the inscriptions into his larger work. The date 1494 given in the 8th Legend as the
year of the discovery of the new lands, and the same date incorporated in Hakluyt’s folio of
1589 from Adams’s map, gave currency to its use to a limited extent.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But Hakluyt’s
larger work of 1598-1600 quite superseded in use his previous books, and Chytræus was
probably rarely seen or consulted; yet Mr. Biddle, who never could have seen Chytræus
or Hakluyt’s folio of 1589, could never understand why later writers, like Harris and
Pinkerton, adopted that date.</p>

<p>I did not propose, in presenting this sketch of authorities relating to the Cabots, in
chronological order, to pursue the inquiry much beyond the period to which I have arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Neither do I flatter myself that I have, in the field already traversed, embraced everything
in printed form that should have been noticed, and something of value may have escaped
me. In proceeding, therefore, to notice two or three important works relating to my theme
published about the period now reached, I shall conclude this chapter by introducing some
important material which has come to light at a later time, from the slumbering archives of
foreign States, and much of it within a few years.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>One of the most important books relating to the history of America was published at
Madrid, 1601-15, by Herrera,&mdash;<i>Historia General</i>. It contains nothing relating to the
first voyages of the Cabots, except the passage from Gomara already cited; but it gives
other interesting facts respecting Sebastian Cabot’s residence in Spain, drawn from official
documents. In citing passages from this work below, I have also made use of the more
recently published works of Navarrete, and even of other writers, where they relate to the
same subject. In the “deceptive conversation” given in the first volume of Ramusio, Cabot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is made to say that the troubles in England induced him, that is, on his return from
his voyage of discovery, to seek employment in Spain. But Peter Martyr informs us that
Cabot did not leave England until after the death of Henry VII., which took place in 1509.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Herrera<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> mentions the circumstances under which the invitation from Ferdinand was given
and accepted, and Cabot arrived in Spain, Sep. 13, 1512.</p>

<p>He was taken into service as “capitan,” with pay of fifty thousand maravedis by a royal
grant made at Lagroño, Oct. 20, 1512.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Eden,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in a translation of Peter Martyr, makes
that author say that Cabot had been, at the time at which Martyr was writing, 1515, appointed
a member of the Council of the Indies, but it is believed that the original language
of Martyr, “concurialis noster,” will not bear that interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In 1515 he was appointed
“Cosmographo de la Casa de la Contratacion,” an office which involved the care of revising
maps and charts.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> And in that same year, Peter Martyr tells us, there was projected a voyage
under the command of Cabot, to search for that “hid secret of Nature” in the northwest,
to sail in the following year, 1516. But the death of King Ferdinand, on the 23d of January
of that year, put an end to the expedition. In November, 1515, Cabot and Juan Vespucius
gave an opinion (<i>parecer</i>) concerning the demarcation line in Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> I have already
spoken of the alleged voyage of Cabot and Sir Thomas Pert from England, of 1516-17,
concerning which serious doubts have been expressed. Herrera makes no mention of
Cabot’s leaving Spain at this time; and De Barcia, not perhaps the highest authority, in the
preface to his <i>Ensayo Chronologico</i>, etc., Madrid, 1723, says that Cabot was residing quietly
in Spain from 1512 to 1526, and that “he never intended or proposed to prosecute the proposed
discovery.” On Feb. 5, 1518, he was appointed “Piloto Mayor y Examinador de
Pilotos,” succeeding Juan de Solis, who had been killed on the La Plata River in 1516, with
the same pay in addition to that of capitano.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In 1520 this appointment is again confirmed,
with orders that no pilot should pass to the Indies without being first examined
and approved by him.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> On April 14, 1524, the celebrated Congress at Badajos was
held, which was attended by Cabot, not as a member but as an expert; and he and
several others delivered an opinion on the questions submitted, April 15, the second day
of the session.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Immediately after the decision of the Congress, which was pronounced
practically in favor of the Spanish interest, a company was formed at Seville to prosecute
the trade to the Moluccas, through the Straits of Magellan, and Cabot was invited to
take the command; and in September of this year he received the sanction of the
Council of the Indies to engage in the enterprise, and the agreement with the Emperor
was executed at Madrid on March 4, 1525, and the title of Captain-General was conferred
upon him. It was intended that the expedition should depart in August, but it
was delayed by the intrigues of the Portuguese, and did not sail till April 3, 1526.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Cabot’s expedition to the La Plata, it having been diverted on the coast from its original
destination, will be considered in another volume. On Oct. 25, 1525, his wife, Catalina
Medrano, was directed by a royal order to receive fifty thousand maravedis as a
“gratificacion.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Cabot returned from South America to Seville with two ships at the end of July or the
beginning of August, 1530, and laid his final report before the Emperor, of which an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
abstract may be found in Herrera. Private complaints were laid against him, and at the
suit of the families of some of his companions who had perished in the expedition he was
arrested and imprisoned, but liberated on bail. Public charges were preferred against him
for misconduct in the affairs of the La Plata, and the Council of the Indies by an order
dated from Medina del Campo, Feb. 1, 1532, condemned him to a banishment of two years
to Oran, in Africa. But the sentence was not carried into execution. Under the date of
1531, Herrera speaks of his wife and children.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>During Cabot’s absence, that is to say, on April 4, 1528, Alonzo de Chaves was
appointed “Piloto Mayor,” with Ribero;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> but the office was resumed by him not long after
his return. Navarrete quotes from the Archivo de Indias a declaration made in 1574, by
Juan Fernandez de Ladrillos, of Moguer, a great pilot, over seventy years old, who had
sailed to America for twenty-eight years, that he was examined by Sebastian Cabot in
1535.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> This office Cabot retained till he left Spain and returned to England.</p>

<p>I may as well introduce here as elsewhere a few passages from that part of the history
of Oviedo recently published at Madrid, for the first time, by the Academy of History.
Oviedo is very severe on Cabot for his want of knowledge and skill in his operations on
the La Plata. But my citations are for another purpose. “Another great pilot (piloto mayor),
Sebastian Cabot, Venetian by origin, educated in England, who at present is Piloto Mayor
and Cosmographer of their Royal Majesties, etc.... I will not defend from passions
... and negligence Sebastian Cabot in the affairs of this expedition, since he is a good
person and skilful in his office of cosmography, and making a map of the whole world in
plane or in a spherical form; but it is not the same thing to command and govern people
as to point a quadrant or an astrolabe.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Several interesting episodes in the life of Cabot during his residence in Spain have been
recently made public from the Venetian archives. They may be related here.</p>

<p>The story of Cabot’s intrigue with the authorities of Venice is told in a remarkable
and interesting letter of Gasparin Contarini, the Venetian ambassador to Charles V., dated
Valladolid, Dec. 31, 1522. Cabot was at this time holding a high office under the Emperor,
and was drawing large pay. It appears that he had made secret proposals to the Council
of Ten through a friend of his, a certain friar, named Hieronimo de Marin, a native of
Ragusa, to enter into the service of Venice, and disclose the strait or passage which he
claimed to have discovered, whereby she would derive a great commercial benefit. He
proposed to visit Venice and lay the whole plan before the Council. The Council of Ten,
though they had but little confidence in the scheme, made all this known to their ambassador
by letter, in which they enclosed a letter also for Cabot, which they had instructed the
friar to write to him. Contarini sent for Cabot, who happened then to be residing at the
court, and gave him his letter, which he there read with manifest embarrassment. After
his fears had been quieted he told Contarini that he had previously, in England, out of the
love he bore his country, spoken to the ambassadors of Venice on the subject of the newly
discovered countries, through which he had the means of benefiting Venice, and that the
letter had reference to that subject; but he besought the ambassador to keep the thing a
secret, as it would cost him his life. Contarini told him that he was thoroughly acquainted
with the whole affair, but they would talk further on the subject in the evening. At the
hour appointed, when they were closeted alone in the ambassador’s chamber, Cabot
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My Lord Ambassador, to tell you the whole truth, I was born in Venice, but was brought up
in England (Io naqui a Venetia, ma sum nutrito in Engelterra), and then entered the service of their
Catholic Majesties of Spain, and King Ferdinand made me a captain, with a salary of 50,000 maravedis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Subsequently his present Majesty gave me the office of Pilot Major, with an additional
salary of 50,000 maravedis, and 25,000 maravedis besides, as a gratuity; forming a total of 125,000
maravedis, equal to about 300 ducats.”</p>

<p class="p1">He then proceeded to say that being in England some three years before, Cardinal
Wolsey offered him high terms if he would sail with an armada of his on a voyage of discovery,
for which preparations were making; but he declined unless the Emperor would
give his consent, in which case he would accept the offer. But meeting with a Venetian
who reproached him for not serving his own country instead of being engaged altogether
for foreigners, his heart smote him, and he wrote the Emperor to recall him, which he did.
And on his return to Seville, and contracting an intimate friendship with this Ragusan friar,
he unbosomed himself to him; and, as the friar was going to Venice, charged him with the
aforesaid message to the Council of the Ten, and to no one else; and the Ragusan “swore
to me a sacred oath to this effect.” Cabot then said he would go to Venice, and lay the
matter before the Council, after getting the Emperor’s consent to go, “on the plea of
recovering his mother’s dowry.” The ambassador approved of this, but made some serious
objections to the feasibility of the scheme which Cabot proposed for the benefit of
Venice. Cabot answered his objections. In the course of the conversation he told Contarini
that he had a method for ascertaining by the needle the distance between two places
from east to west, which had never been previously discovered by any one. The interview
was concluded by his promising to go to Venice at his own expense, and return in
like manner if his plan was disapproved by the Council. He then urged Contarini to
keep the matter secret.</p>

<p>On the following 7th of March the ambassador again wrote to the Chiefs of the Ten,
saying that Cabot had been several times to see him, and that he was disposed to come to
Venice to carry his purpose into effect, but that he did not then dare ask leave for fear he
might be suspected of going to England, and he must wait three months longer; and that
Cabot desired the Council to write him a letter urging him to come to Venice for the dispatch
of his affairs (meaning his private business). On the 28th of April the Council, in
the name of the Ragusan friar, wrote to Cabot what had been done to discover where his
property was; that there was good hope of recovering the dower of his mother and aunt,
and that had he been present no doubt the object would have been attained before. He
is therefore urged to come at once, “for your aunt is very old.” The Council say they
have caused this letter to be written “touching his private affairs, in order that it may
appear necessary for him to quit Spain.” On the 26th of July, Contarini again writes that
Cabot, who had been residing at Seville, had come to Valladolid on his way to Venice, and
was endeavoring to get leave of the Imperial Councillors to go, and that the Signory would
be informed of the result of the application. Probably he never went. The next mention
of him in the Venetian correspondence, during his residence in Spain, is under the date
of September 21, 1525,&mdash;that Sebastian Cabot is captain of the fleet preparing for the
Indies.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Cabot still kept up his intrigues with Venice, even after his return to England. On the
12th of September, 1551, the Council of Ten write to their ambassador in England, telling
him to assure Cabot that they are gratified by his offer, and that they will do all they can
about the recovery of his property there, but that it is necessary that he should come personally
to Venice, as no one there knows him; that the matters concerned are over fifty
years old, and by the death of men, decay of houses, and perishing of writings, as well as
by his own absence, no assured knowledge can be arrived at. He should therefore come
at once. Ramusio, the Secretary of the Council, had been put in trust by Cabot of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
such evidences as should come to hand regarding Cabot’s business, and he would use all
diligence towards establishing his rights. In the mean time the ambassador is to learn
from him all he can about this navigation.</p>

<p>Whether this talk about Cabot’s property in Venice, the dowry from his mother and
his aged aunt, was all fictitious, perhaps never can be known. That these alleged facts
were used as a pretext or “blind” in this correspondence, was on both sides avowed.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>It has been already mentioned, that, after Cabot’s return to England, and his entry into
the service of Edward VI.,&mdash;a warrant for his transportation hither from Spain having
passed the Privy Council on the 9th of Oct. 1547,&mdash;the King, on the 6th of January, 1548/9,
granted him a pension for life of £166 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, “in consideration of good and acceptable service
done and to be done by him.” But in the following year a little <i>contretemps</i> occurred
between Cabot and the Emperor Charles V. Through the Spanish ambassador, Jan. 19,
1549/50, Charles had demanded the return of Cabot to Spain, saying that he was the “Grand
Pilot of the Emperor’s Indies, ... a very necessary man for the Emperor, whose servant
he was, and had a pension of him.” The Council replied that Cabot was not detained
by them, but that he had refused to go, saying that being the King’s subject there was no
reason why he should be compelled to go. The ambassador insisted that Cabot should
declare his mind to him personally; and an interview was held, at which Cabot made a
declaration to the same import, but said he was willing to write to the Emperor, having
good-will towards him, concerning some matters important for the Emperor to know. He
was then asked if he would return to Spain if the King of England and the Council should
demand of him to go; to which Cabot made an equivocal answer, but which the Council, to
whom a report of the conversation was made by a third person present, interpreted to
mean that he would not go, as he had divers times before declared to them.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1551, Sebastian Cabot received from the King a special reward of £200. On
the 9th of September, 1553, soon after the accession of Philip and Mary, the Emperor,
Charles V., again made an earnest request that Cabot should return to Spain. But he
declined to go. On the 27th of November, 1555, Cabot’s pension was renewed to him.
Edward VI. having died two years previous, the former grant had probably expired with
him. On the 27th of May, 1557, Cabot resigned his pension, and on the 29th a new grant
was made to him and to William Worthington, jointly, of the same amount, so that Cabot
was bereft of half his pay.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Cabot died not long afterwards, the precise date, however,
not being known.</p>

<p>Mr. Biddle was strongly impressed with the belief that Cabot suffered great neglect and
injustice in his last days from Philip, through the jealousy of Spain of the growing commerce
and maritime enterprise of England, stimulated by one who had left his father’s
service and refused to return, and “who was now imparting to others the benefit of his
vast experience and accumulated stores of knowledge.” And he believed that William
Worthington, who was associated with Cabot in the last grant to him of his pension, was
a creature of Spain, who finally got possession of Cabot’s papers, and confiscated them
beyond the reach of the students and statesmen of England.</p>

<p>I will now call attention to some documents recently made public, principally derived
from the archives of Venice and of Spain, which reveal John Cabot again to our view and
show him to have been the real discoverer of North America.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>John Cabot, or in the Venetian dialect, Zuan Caboto, was probably born in Genoa or its
neighborhood, and came to Venice as early as 1461. He there married a daughter of the
country, by whom he had three sons. On the 28th of March, 1476, by the unanimous consent
of the Senate, he obtained his naturalization as a citizen of Venice,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> “within and
without,” having resided there fifteen years.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He engaged in the study of cosmography
and the practice of navigation, and at one time visited Mecca, where the caravans brought in
the spices from distant lands. He subsequently left Venice with his family for England and
took up his residence in Bristol, then one of the principal maritime cities of that country.
Sebastian is reported as saying that his father went to England to follow the trade of merchandise.
When this removal took place is uncertain. Peter Martyr says that Sebastian,
the second son, at the time was a little child (<i>pene infans</i>), while Sebastian himself says,
if correctly reported, that he was very young (<i>che egli era assai giouare</i>), yet that he had
some knowledge of the <i>humanities</i> and of the sphere. He therefore must have arrived at
some maturity of years.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Eden<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> says that Sebastian told him that he was born in Bristol,
and was taken to Venice when he was four years old, and brought back again after certain
years. He told Contarini, at a most solemn interview, that he was born in Venice and
bred (<i>nutrito</i>) in England, which is probably true. It is reasonable to suppose that the
three sons were of age when the letters patent were granted to them and their father in
March, 1496, in which case Sebastian, being the second son, must have been born as early
as 1473, or three years before his father took out his papers of naturalization in Venice.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In a letter from Ferdinand and Isabella to Doctor de Puebla, in London, dated March
28, 1496, they say, after acknowledging his letter of the 21st of January: “You write that a
person like Columbus has come to England for the purpose of persuading the King to enter
into an undertaking similar to that of the Indies, without prejudice to Spain and Portugal.
He is quite at liberty.” But Puebla is further charged to see that the King of
England, who they think has had this temptation laid before him by the King of France,
is not deceived in this matter, for that these undertakings cannot be executed without
prejudice to Spain and Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>A reasonable inference from this would be, that John Cabot had arrived in England not
long before the date of Puebla’s letter to their Majesties, to lay his proposals before Henry
VII., as Columbus had done some years before through his brother, and not that he had
been a long resident in the country. The letters patent had already been issued, that is to
say, on the 5th of March.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> This letter from Spain may have caused some delay in the sailing
of the expedition, which did not depart till the following year. But some time was
necessary to beat up recruits for the voyage, and to enlist the aid of the substantial citizens
of Bristol in the undertaking. John Cabot, accompanied perhaps by his son Sebastian,
finally sailed in the early part of May, 1497, with one small vessel and eighteen persons,
“almost all Englishmen and from Bristol,” says Raimondo; who adds, “The chief men of
the enterprise are of Bristol, great sailors.” A few foreigners were included in the company,
as we learn from the same authority that a Burgundian and a Genoese accompanied
them. The name of the vessel is said to have been the “Matthew.” Mr. Barrett<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> says:
“In the year 1497, June 24th, on St. John’s day, as it is in a manuscript in my possession,
‘was Newfoundland found by Bristol men in a ship called the Matthew.’” How much of
this paragraph was in the manuscript is not clear. The first part of it was evidently taken
from Hakluyt. And we are not told whether the manuscript was ancient or modern. It
cannot now be found.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>John Cabot returned in the early part of August. The following well-known memorandum,
from the Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VII., “August 10, 1497: To him who
found the New Isle, 10<i>l.</i>,” is supposed to refer to him.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Additional evidence concerning the voyage will now be given. The following is a letter
from Lorenzo Pasqualigo, a merchant residing in London, to his brothers in Venice, dated
August 23d, 1497, which I have somewhat abridged:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The Venetian, our countryman, who went with a ship from Bristol, is returned, and says that
700 leagues hence he discovered land in the territory of the Grand Cham. He coasted 300 leagues
and landed, saw no human beings, but brought to the king certain snares set to catch game, and a
needle for making nets. Was three months on the voyage. The king has promised that in the
spring our countryman shall have ten ships. The king has also given him money wherewith to
amuse himself till then, and he is now in Bristol with his wife, who is also a Venetian, and with his
sons. His name is Zuan Cabot, and he is styled the great Admiral. Vast honor is paid him.
The discoverer planted on his new-found land a large cross, with one flag of England and one of
St. Mark, by reason of his being a Venetian.... London, 23d of August, 1497.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p class="p1">On the following day, August 24, 1497, Raimondo de Soncino, envoy of the Duke of
Milan to Henry VII., wrote the following passage in a long dispatch to his Government:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Also, some months ago, his Majesty sent out a Venetian who is a very good mariner, and has
good skill in discovering new islands, and he has returned safe, and has found two very large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fertile new islands, having likewise discovered The Seven Cities, four hundred leagues from England
in the western passage. This next spring his Majesty means to send him with fifteen or
twenty ships.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In the following December, Raimondo de Soncino wrote another letter from London,
making more particular mention of John Cabot’s discovery, and of the intention of the King
to authorize another expedition. This letter, from the State Archives of Milan, was first
published in the <i>Annuario Scientifico</i>, in 1865,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and is now published in English for the
first time. There is some obscurity in the letter in a few places, in naming the direction
in which the vessel sailed, as the east when the west was evidently intended. Whether
this was a clerical error, or whether by the term “the east” was meant “the land of the
spices” to which the expedition was bound, and which in the language of the day lay to
the east, is uncertain. Neither is the geographical object named as “Tanais” recognized.
This letter throws no light on the Landfall. I am indebted to Professor Bennet
H. Nash, of Harvard College, for revising the translation of this letter.</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Most Illustrious and Excellent My Lord</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps among your Excellency’s many occupations, it may not displease you to learn how
his Majesty here has won a part of Asia without a stroke of the sword. There is in this kingdom
a Venetian fellow, Master John Caboto by name, of a fine mind, greatly skilled in navigation, who
seeing that those most serene kings, first he of Portugal, and then the one of Spain, have occupied
unknown islands, determined to make a like acquisition for his Majesty aforesaid. And having
obtained royal grants that he should have the usufruct of all that he should discover, provided that
the ownership of the same is reserved to the crown, with a small ship and eighteen persons he
committed himself to fortune; and having set out from Bristol, a western port of this kingdom, and
passed the western limits of Hibernia, and then standing to the northward he began to steer eastward,
leaving (after a few days) the North Star on his right hand; and, having wandered about
considerably, at last he fell in with <i>terra firma</i>, where, having planted the royal banner and taken
possession on behalf of this King, and taken certain tokens, he has returned thence. The said
Master John, as being foreign-born and poor, would not be believed if his comrades, who are
almost all Englishmen and from Bristol, did not testify that what he says is true. This Master
John has the description of the world in a chart, and also in a solid globe which he has made, and
he [or the chart and the globe] shows where he landed, and that going toward the east he passed
considerably beyond the country of the Tanais. And they say that it is a very good and temperate
country, and they think that Brazil-wood and silks grow there; and they affirm that that sea is
covered with fishes, which are caught not only with the net but with baskets, a stone being tied to
them in order that the baskets may sink in the water. And this I heard the said Master John
relate, and the aforesaid Englishmen, his comrades, say that they will bring so many fishes that
this kingdom will no longer have need of Iceland, from which country there comes a very great
store of fish which are called stock-fish. But Master John has set his mind on something greater;
for he expects to go farther on toward the East (Levant,) from that place already occupied, constantly
hugging the shore, until he shall be over against [or “on the other side of”] an island, by
him called Cipango, situated in the equinoctial region, where he thinks all the spices of the world,
and also the precious stones, originate; and he says that in former times he was at Mecca, whither
spices are brought by caravans from distant countries, and that those who brought them, on being
asked where the said spices grow, answered that they do not know, but that other caravans come
to their homes with this merchandise from distant countries, and these [caravans] again say that
they are brought to them from other remote regions. And he argues thus,&mdash;that if the Orientals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
affirmed to the Southerners that these things come from a distance from them, and so from hand
to hand, presupposing the rotundity of the earth, it must be that the last ones get them at the
North toward the West; and he said it in such a way, that, having nothing to gain or lose by it, I
too believe it: and what is more, the King here, who is wise and not lavish, likewise puts some
faith in him; for (ever) since his return he has made good provision for him, as the same Master
John tells me. And it is said that, in the spring, his Majesty afore-named will fit out some ships,
and will besides give him all the convicts, and they will go to that country to make a colony, by
means of which they hope to establish in London a greater storehouse of spices than there is in
Alexandria; and the chief men of the enterprise are of Bristol, great sailors, who, now that they
know where to go, say that it is not a voyage of more than fifteen days, nor do they ever have
storms after they get away from Hibernia. I have also talked with a Burgundian, a comrade
of Master John’s, who confirms everything, and wishes to return thither because the Admiral (for
so Master John already entitles himself) has given him an island; and he has given another one to
a barber of his from Castiglione-of-Genoa, and both of them regard themselves as Counts, nor does
my Lord the Admiral esteem himself anything less than a Prince. I think that with this expedition
there will go several poor Italian monks, who have all been promised bishoprics. And, as I have
become a friend of the Admiral’s, if I wished to go thither I should get an archbishopric. But
I have thought that the benefices which your Excellency has in store for me are a surer thing; and
therefore I beg that if these should fall vacant in my absence, you will cause possession to be
given to me, taking measures to do this rather [especially] where it is needed, in order that they be
not taken from me by others, who because they are present can be more diligent than I, who
in this country have been brought to the pass of eating ten or twelve dishes at every meal, and
sitting at table three hours at a time twice a day, for the sake of your Excellency, to whom I humbly
commend myself.</p>

<p class="p1">These letters are sufficient to show that North America was discovered by John Cabot,
the name of Sebastian being nowhere mentioned in them, and that the discovery was
made in 1497. The place which he first sighted is given on the map of 1544 as the north
part of Cape Breton Island, on which is inscribed “prima tierra vista,” which was reached,
according to the Legend, on the 24th of June. Pasqualigo, the only one who mentions it,
says he coasted three hundred leagues. Mr. Brevoort, who accepts the statement, thinks
he made the <i>periplus</i> of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, passing out at the straits of Belle Isle,
and thence home.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> He saw no human beings, so that the story of men dressed in bear-skins
and otherwise described in the Legend must have been seen by Sebastian Cabot on
a later voyage. The extensive sailing up and down the coast described by chroniclers
from conversations with Sebastian Cabot many years afterwards, though apparently told
as occurring on the voyage of discovery,&mdash;as only one voyage is ever mentioned,&mdash;must
have taken place on a later voyage. There was no time between the 24th of June and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the 1st of August for any very extensive explorations. Indeed, John Cabot intimated to
Raimondo that he intended on the next voyage to start from the place he had already
found, and run down the coast towards the equinoctial regions, where he expected to find
the island of Cipango and the country of jewels and spices. No doubt he was anxious to
return and report his discovery thus far, and provide “for greater things.” The plea of a
shortness of provisions
may have covered
another motive.
The great abundance
of fish reported might
have supplied any immediate want.</p>

<p>John Cabot was now in high
favor with the King, who supplied
him with money, by which he was
able to make a fine appearance.
Indeed, the
King granted him under
the great seal, during the royal
pleasure, a pension of twenty
pounds sterling per annum, having
the purchasing value of two
hundred pounds at the present
time; to date from the preceding
25th of March. The grant was a
charge upon the customs of the
port of Bristol. The document
authorizing this grant we are able
to present here for the first time
in print. The order from the
King is dated the 13th of December,
1497, and it passed the seals
the 28th of January, 1498:<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Preparations were now made for a second voyage, and a license to John Cabot alone,
as we have already seen, was issued by the King, for leave to take up six ships and to
enlist as many of the King’s subjects as were willing to go. This was evidently a scheme
of colonization. Peter Martyr says, if this is the voyage which he is describing, that
Sebastian Cabot&mdash;for he never speaks of John&mdash;furnished two ships at his own charge,
and Sebastian Cabot, in Ramusio, says that the King furnished them, and the Bristol
merchants are supposed to have furnished three others; and they took out three hundred
men.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The Fabian manuscript quoted by Hakluyt says they sailed in the beginning of
May; and De Ayala says they were expected back by September. There is no doubt
that Sebastian Cabot accompanied his father on this voyage. From the documents
already cited from Peter Martyr and Ramusio there is some reason to believe that the
expedition coasted some distance to the north, and then returning ran down the coast
as far as to the 36° N. without accomplishing the purpose for which they went. That
this latter course was pursued receives some confirmation from the declarations of John
Cabot on his return from the first voyage, that he believed it practicable to reach in that
direction the Island of Cipango and the land of the spices. But the prospects were discouraging
and their provisions failed. Gomara, in noticing this voyage, says that on their
return from the north they stopped at Baccalaos for refreshment. But all the accounts
relied on for this voyage are vague and, as we have already seen, unsatisfying.</p>

<p>The following letter from the Prothonotary, Don Pedro de Ayala, residing in London,
to Ferdinand and Isabella, dated July 25, 1498, relates to the sailing of this expedition:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I think your Majesties have already heard that the King of England has equipped a fleet in
order to discover certain islands and continents which he was informed some people from Bristol,
who manned a few ships for the same purpose last year, had found. I have seen the map which
the discoverer has made, who is another Genoese like Columbus, and who has been in Seville and
in Lisbon asking assistance for his discoveries. The people of Bristol have, for the last seven years,
sent out every year two, three, or four light ships in search of the Island of Brazil and the Seven
Cities, according to the fancy of this Genoese. The King determined to send out ships, because the
year before they brought certain news that they had found land. His fleet consisted of five vessels,
which carried provisions for one year. It is said that one of them, in which Friar Buel went, has
returned to Ireland in great distress, the ship being much damaged. The Genoese has continued
his voyage. I have seen on a chart the direction which they took and the distance they sailed;
and I think that what they have found, or what they are in search of, is what your Highnesses
already possess. It is expected that they will be back in the month of September.... I think
it is not further distant than 400 leagues.... I do not now send the chart, or <i>mapa mundi</i>, which
that man has made, and which, according to my opinion, is false, since it makes it appear as if the
land in question was not the said islands.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p class="p1">We see by this letter that this “Genoese,” who had discovered land the year before, had
again sailed on the expedition here described. If so important a person as John Cabot
now was to the King had died before its departure, the fact would have been known at
court, and De Ayala would surely have mentioned it, as the Spaniards were very jealous
of all these proceedings. The statement that the King had equipped the fleet may only
mean that the expedition was fitted and sent out under his countenance and protection.
De Ayala says it was expected back in September, but it had not returned by the last of
October. No one knows when the expedition returned, and no one knows what became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of John Cabot. When the domestic calendars of the reign of Henry VII. are published,
some clew to him may turn up. In the mean time we must wait patiently.</p>

<p>The enterprise was regarded as a failure, and no doubt the Bristol and London
adventurers suffered a pecuniary loss. All schemes of Western discovery and colonization
were for years substantially abandoned by England. Some feeble attempts in this
direction appear to have been made in 1501 and 1502, when patents for discovery were
granted by Henry in favor of some merchants of Bristol, with whom were associated several
Portuguese, but it is not certain that anything was done under their authority.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">HAWKINS AND DRAKE.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE REV. EDWARD EVERETT HALE, D.D.,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE English voyagers had no mind to content themselves with adventure
in those more rugged regions to which the Cabots had
introduced them. Whether in peace or war, their relations with Spain
were growing closer and closer all through the sixteenth century. Sebastian
Cabot, in fact, soon passed into the service of the Spanish Crown.
Indeed, if we had no other memorial of the intimacy between English
and Spanish navigators, we could still trace it in our language, which has
derived many of its maritime words from Spanish originals. The seamen
of England found their way everywhere, and soon acquainted themselves
with the coasts of the West India Islands and the Spanish main. There
exists, indeed, in the English archives a letter written as early as 1518
by the Treasurer-General of the West Indies to Queen Katherine, the unhappy
wife of Henry VIII., in which he describes to her the peculiarities
of his island home. He sends to her a cloak of feathers such as were worn
by native princesses. From that time forward, allusions to the new discoveries
appear in English literature and in the history of English trade.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Still, it would be fair to say, that, for thirty years after the discovery of
America, that continent attracted as little attention in England as the discovery
of the Antarctic continent, forty years ago, has attracted in America
up to this time.</p>

<p>It belongs to another chapter to trace the gradual steps by which the
English fisheries developed England’s knowledge of America. The instincts
of trade led men farther south, in a series of voyages which will
be briefly traced in this chapter. One of the earliest of them, which may
be taken as typical, is that of William Hawkins, of Plymouth. Not content
with the short voyages commonly made to the known coasts of Europe,
Hawkins “armed out a tall and goodly ship of his own,” in which he
made three voyages to Brazil, and skirted, after the fashion of the time,
the African coast. He carried thither negroes whom he had taken on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
coast of Guinea. He deserves the credit, therefore, such as it is, of beginning
that African slave-trade in which England was engaged for nearly
three centuries.</p>

<p>The second of these voyages seems to have been made as early as
1530. He brought to England, from the coast of Brazil, a savage
king, whose ornaments, apparel, behavior, and gestures were very strange
to the English king and his nobility. These three voyages were so successful,
that a number of Southampton merchants followed them up, at
least as late as 1540.</p>

<p>It was, however, William Hawkins’s son John who was knighted by
Queen Elizabeth for his success in the slave-trade, and in acknowledgment
of the wealth which his voyages brought into England. Engaging
several of his friends, some of whom were noblemen, in the adventure,
John Hawkins sailed with a fleet of three ships and one hundred men for
the coast of Guinea, in October, 1562. He took&mdash;partly by the sword,
and partly by other means&mdash;three hundred or more negroes, whom he
carried to San Domingo, then called Hispaniola, and sold profitably. In
his own ships he brought home hides, ginger, sugar, and some pearls.
He sent two other ships with hides and other commodities to Spain.
These were seized by the Spanish Government, and it is curious that
Hawkins should not have known that they would be. His ignorance
seems to show that his adventure was substantially a novelty in that time.
He himself arrived in England again in September, 1563. Notwithstanding
the loss of half his profits in Spain, the voyage brought much gain
to himself and the other adventurers.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Hawkins sailed again, the next year, with four ships,
of which the largest was the “Jesus,” of Lubec, of seven hundred tons;
the smallest was the “Swallow,” of only thirty tons. He had a hundred
and seventy men; and, as in all such voyages, the ships were armed.
Passing down the coast of Guinea, they spent December and January in
picking up their wretched freight, and lost by sickness and in fights with
the negroes many of their men. On the 29th of January, 1565, they had
taken in their living cargo, and then they crossed to the West Indies. On
the voyage they were becalmed for twenty-one days. But they arrived at
the Island of Dominica, then in possession of savages, on the 9th of
March. From that period till the 31st of May, they were trading on the
Spanish coasts, and then returned to England, touching at various points
in the West Indies. They passed along the whole coast of Florida, and
they are the first Englishmen who give us in detail any account of
Florida.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Hawkins’s great good fortune to come to the relief of the struggling
colony of Laudonnière, then in the second year of its wretched
history. From his narrative we learn that the settlers had made twenty
hogsheads of wine in a single summer from the native grapes, which is
perhaps more than has been done there since in the same period of
time.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The wretched
colonists owed everything
to the kindness
of Hawkins. He left
them a vessel in
which to return to
France; and they had
made all their preparations
so to do,
when they were relieved&mdash;for
their ultimate
destruction, as
it proved&mdash;by the
arrival of a squadron
under Ribault.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Hawkins
returned to England
after a voyage
sufficiently prosperous,
which had lasted
eleven months. He
had lost twenty persons
in all; but he
had brought home
gold, silver, pearls,
and other jewels in
great store.</p>

</div></div>

<p>His account of
Florida is much more
careful than what he
gives of any of the
West India Islands.
From his own words
it is clear that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
thought it might be of use to England, and that he wanted to draw attention
to it as a place open to colonization. Like so many other explorers,
from Ponce de Leon down to our own times, he was surprised that a country,
which is so attractive to the eye, should be left so nearly without inhabitants.
It seems to have been more densely peopled when Ponce de Leon landed
there in 1513 than it was at the beginning of this century. To such interest
or enthusiasm of Hawkins do we owe an account of Florida, in its native
condition, more full than we have of any other of our States, excepting
New Mexico, at a period so early in our history.</p>

<p>Besides tobacco, he specifies the abundance of sorrel,&mdash;which grew as
abundantly as grass,&mdash;of maize, of mill, and of grapes, which “taste much
like our English grapes.” He describes the community building of the
southern tribes, as made “like a great barne, in strength not inferiour to
ours,” with stanchions and rafters of whole trees, and covered with palmetto
leaves. There was one small room for the king and queen, but no other
subdivisions. In the midst of the great hall a fire was kept all night. The
houses, indeed, were only used at night.</p>

<p>In a country of such a climate and soil, with “marvellous store of deer
and divers other beasts, and fowl and fish sufficient,” Hawkins naturally
thought that “a man might live,” as he says quaintly. Maize, he says,
“maketh good savory bread, and cakes as fine as flower.” The first account
to be found in English literature of the “hasty pudding” of the American
larder, the “mush” of the Pennsylvanians,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> is in Hawkins’s narrative. “It
maketh good meal, beaten, and sodden with water, and eateth like pap
wherewith we feed children.” The Frenchmen, fond by nature of soup,
had made another use of it, not wholly forgotten at this day. “It maketh
also good beverage, sodden in water and nourishable; which the Frenchmen
did use to drink of in the morning, and it assuaged their thirst so that
they had no need to drink all the day after.” It was, he says, because the
French had been too lazy to plant maize for themselves that their colony
came to such wretched destitution. To obtain maize, they had made war
against the so-called savages who had raised it, and this aggression had
naturally reacted against them.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that in all these early narratives of the slave-trade
there is no intimation that it involved cruelty or any form of wrong.
Hawkins sailed in the ship “Jesus,” with faith as sincere as if he had sailed
on a crusade. His sailing orders to his four ships close with words which
remind one of Cromwell: “Serve God daily; love one another; preserve
your victuals; beware of fire; and keep good company.” By “serve
God,” it is meant that the ship’s company shall join in religious services
morning and evening; and this these slave-traders regularly did. In one
of their incursions on the Guinea coast they were almost destroyed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
native negroes, as they well deserved to be. Hawkins narrates the adventure
with this comment: “God, who worketh all things for the best, would
not have it so, and by him we escaped without danger. His name be
praised for it!” And again, when they were nearly starved, becalmed in
mid-ocean: “Almighty God, who never suffereth his elect to perish, sent
us the ordinary breeze.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The success of the second voyage was such that a coat-of-arms was
granted to Hawkins. Translated from the jargon of heraldry, the grant
means that he might bear on his black shield a golden lion walking over
the waves. Above the lion were three golden coins. For a crest he was
to have a figure of half a Moor, “bound, and a captive,” with golden
amulets on his arms and ears. No disgrace attached to the capturing
of Africans and selling them for money. That the Heralds’ Office might
give to the transaction the sanctions of Christianity, it directed Hawkins,
five years after, to add in one corner of the shield the pilgrim’s scallop-shell
in gold, between two palmer’s staves, as if to intimate that the African
slave-trade was the true crusade of the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>So successful was this expedition, that Hawkins started on a third, with
five ships, in October, 1567. He commanded his old ship, the “Jesus,” and
Francis Drake, afterward so celebrated, commanded the “Judith,” a little
vessel of fifty tons. They took four or five hundred negroes, and crossed
to Dominica again, but were more than seven weeks on the passage. As
before, they passed along the Spanish main, where they found the Spaniards
had been cautioned against them. They absolutely stormed the town of
Rio de la Hacha before they could obtain permission to trade. In all cases,
although the Spanish officers had been instructed to oppose their trade,
they found that negroes were so much in demand that the planters dealt
with them eagerly. After a repulse at Cartagena, they crossed the Gulf of
Mexico towards Florida, but were finally compelled, by two severe tempests,
to run to San Juan d’ Ulua, the port of Mexico, for repairs and supplies.
Here they claimed the privileges of allies of King Philip, and were
at first well enough received. Hawkins takes to himself credit that he did
not seize twelve ships which he found there, with, £200,000 of silver on
board. The local officers sent to the City of Mexico, about two hundred
miles inland, for instructions. The next day a fleet from Spain, of twelve
ships, arrived in the offing. Hawkins, fearing the anger of his Queen, he
says, let them come into harbor, having made a compact with the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that neither side should make war against the other. The fleet entered,
and for three days all was amity and courtesy. But on the fourth day, from
the shore and from the ships, the five English vessels were attacked furiously,
and in that little harbor a naval action ensued, of which the result
was the flight of the “Minion” and the “Judith” alone, and the capture
or destruction of the other English vessels. So crowded was the “Minion,”
that a hundred of the fugitives preferred to land, rather than to tempt the
perils of the sea in her. They fell into the hands of the Inquisition, and
their sufferings were horrible. The others, after a long and stormy passage,
arrived in England on the 25th of January, 1568/69.</p>

<p>It is a real misfortune for our early history that no reliance can be
placed on the fragmentary stories of the few survivors who were left by
Hawkins on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. One or two there were who,
after years of captivity, told their wretched story at home. But it is so
disfigured by every form of lie, that the most ingenious reconstructer of
history fails to distil from it even a drop of the truth. The routes which
they pursued cannot be traced, the etymology of geography gains nothing
from their nomenclature, and, in a word, the whole story has to be consigned
to the realm of fable.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Such a narrative as these men might have
told would be our best guide for what has been well called by Mr. Haven
“the mythical century” of American history.</p>

<p>In this voyage of Hawkins the Earls of Pembroke and of Leicester
were among the adventurers.</p>

<p>If Hawkins’s account of the perfidy of the Spaniards at San Juan d’Ulua
be true,&mdash;and it has never been contradicted,&mdash;the Spanish Crown that day
brought down a storm of misery and rapine from which it never fairly recovered.
The accursed doctrine of the Inquisition, that no faith was to be
kept with heretics, proved a dangerous doctrine for Spain when the heretics
were such men as Hawkins, Cavendish, and Drake. On that day Francis
Drake learned his lesson of Spanish treachery; and he learned it so well
that he determined on his revenge. That revenge he took so thoroughly,
that for more than a hundred years he is spoken of in all Spanish annals
as “The Dragon.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Hawkins gives no account of Drake’s special service in the “Judith,”&mdash;the
smallest vessel in the unfortunate squadron, and one of the two which
returned to England; nor has Drake himself left any which has been discovered;
nor have his biographers. Clearly his ill-fortune did not check his
eagerness for attack; and from that time forward Spain had at least one
determined enemy in England.</p>

</div>

<p>He had made two voyages to the West Indies in 1570 and in 1571, of
which little is known. For a fifth voyage, which he calls the third of importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he fitted out a little squadron of only two vessels, the “Pasha” and
the “Swan,” and sailed in 1572, with no pretence of trade, simply to attack
and ravage the
Spanish main.
He specially
assigns as his
motive for this
enterprise his
desire to inflict
vengeance for injuries done him at Rio de Hacha in 1565 and in 1566, and, in
particular, that he might retaliate on Henriques, Viceroy of Mexico, for his
treachery at San Juan d’ Ulua. It seems that he had vainly sought amends
at the Court of Spain, and that the Queen’s diplomacy had been equally
ineffective. The little squadron, enlarged by a third vessel which joined
them after sailing, attacked Nombre de Dios, then the granary of the West
Indies, but with small success. They then insulted the port of Cartagena,
and afterward, having made an alliance with the Cimaronnes, since and
now known as Maroons,&mdash;a tribe of savages and self-freed Africans,&mdash;they
marched across the isthmus, and Drake obtained his first sight of that
Pacific Ocean which he was afterward to explore. “Vehemently transported
with desire to navigate that sea, he fell upon his knees and implored
the divine assistance that he might at some time sail thither and make a
perfect discovery of the same.” The place from which Drake saw it was
probably near the spot where Balboa “thanked God for that great discovery,”
and that he had been first of Christian men to behold that sea.
His discovery was made in 1513, sixty years before Drake renewed it.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The narrative which we cite is in the words of the historian Camden.
Camden tells us also that Drake had “gotten together a pretty sum of
money” in this expedition, and, satisfied for the moment, he remained in
England. He engaged himself in assisting, at sea, in the reduction of
Ireland. But he had by no means done with the Spaniards, and at the
end of 1577, sailing on the 15th of November, he left Plymouth on the
celebrated voyage in which he was to sail round the world. The squadron
consisted of the “Pelican,” of one hundred tons, the “Elizabeth,” of eighty,
the “Swan,” of fifty, and the “Marigold” and “Christopher,” of thirty and
of fifteen tons. Of these vessels the “Pelican” was the only one which completed
the great adventure. Her armament was twenty guns of brass and
iron. She had others in her hold. So well had Drake profited by earlier
expeditions, that his equipment was complete, and even luxurious. He
carried pinnaces in parts, to be put together when needed. He had
“expert musicians, rich furniture, all the vessels for the table, yea, many
even of the cook-room, being of pure silver.” In every detail he was prepared
to show the magnificence and the civilization of his own country.</p>

<p>The crew were shipped and the expedition sailed, with the pretence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
voyage to Egypt. This was to blind the Spanish envoys, in concealment of
the real object of the expedition, as similar expeditions since have been
veiled. But it is clear enough that the partners in the enterprise and the
men they shipped knew very well whither they were faring.</p>

<p>After one rebuff, the fleet finally left England on the 13th of December,
1577, and, with occasional pauses to refit at the Cape de Verde and at different
points not frequented by the Portuguese or Spaniards on the Brazilian
coast and the coast south of Brazil, they arrived at Port St. Julian on
the 19th of June, in the beginning of the southern winter. Here they spent
two months, not sailing again until the 17th of August, when they essayed
the passage of the Straits of Magellan. While at Port St. Julian Drake
found, or professed to find, evidences of the treachery of Doughty, one
of the gentlemen in whom at first he had most confided. Doughty was
tried before a jury of twelve, found guilty, and beheaded. They all remembered
that Magellan had had a similar experience in the same harbor
fifty-seven years before. Indeed they found the gibbet on which, as they
supposed, John of Cartagena had been hanged by Magellan, with his
mouldering bones below. The Spaniards said that Drake himself acted
as Doughty’s executioner. Fletcher says, “he who acted in the room of
provost marshal.” It is hard to see how the Spaniards should know.</p>

<p>After a series of stormy adventures, they found themselves safe in the
Pacific on the 28th of October. After really passing the straits, they had
been driven far south by tempests, and on the extreme point of Tierra del
Fuego Drake had landed. On a grassy point he fell upon the ground at
length, and extended his arms as widely as possible, as if to grasp the
southern end of the hemisphere,&mdash;in memory, perhaps, of Cæsar’s taking
possession of England. The “Pelican” was the only vessel now under his
command. The others had either been lost or had deserted him; and
though he sought for his consorts all the way on his voyage northward, he
sought in vain.</p>

<p>From Drake’s own pen we have no narrative of this remarkable voyage.
His chaplain, Fletcher,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> gives a good account of Patagonia and of the
natives, from the observations made in Port St. Julian and in their after
experiences as they passed the straits. The Englishmen corrected at once
the Spanish fable regarding the marvellous height of these men. They
corrected errors which they supposed the Spaniards had intentionally published
in the charts. It is supposed that Drake sighted the Falkland
Islands, which had been discovered by Davis a few years before. Drake
gave the name of Elizabeth Islands, or the Elizabethides, to the whole
group of Tierra del Fuego and its neighbors.</p>

<p>In their voyage north they touched for supplies at a great island, which
the Spaniards called Mucho; and afterward at Valparaiso, where they
plundered a great ship called the “Captain of the South,” which they found
at anchor there. Fletcher describes all such plunder with a clumsy raillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
as if a Spaniard’s plunder were always fair game. To Drake it was indeed
repayment for San Juan d’ Ulua. Farther north, they entered the bay
of “Cyppo;” and in another bay, still farther north, they set up the pinnace
which they had in parts on board their vessel. In this pinnace
Drake sailed south a day to look for his consorts; but he was driven
back by adverse winds. After
a stay of a month here, which
added nothing to our knowledge
of the geography of the
country, they sailed again.
“Cyppo” is probably the
Copiapo of to-day.</p>

<p>Pausing for plunder, or for
water, or fresh provisions, from
time to time, they ran in, on
the 7th of February, to the
port of Arica, where they
spoiled the vessels they found,
generally confining their plunder
to silver, gold, and jewels,
and such stores as they needed
for immediate use. At Callao
they found no news of their
comrades; but they did find
news from Europe,&mdash;the
death of the kings of Portugal, of France, of Morocco, and of Fez, and of
the Pope of Rome. From one vessel they took fifteen hundred bars of
silver, and learning that a treasure-ship had sailed a fortnight before, went
rapidly in pursuit of her.</p>

<p>They overtook her on the 1st of March, and captured her. As part
of her cargo, she had on board “a certain quantity of jewels and precious
stones,” thirteen chests of silver reals, eighty pounds weight of gold,
twenty-six tons of uncoined silver, two very fair gilt silver drinking-bowls,
“and the like trifles,&mdash;valued in all about three hundred and sixty thousand
pezoes,”&mdash;as Fletcher says in his clumsy pleasantry. The ships lay
together six days, then Drake “gave the master a little linen and the like
for his commodities,” and let him and his ship go. Her name, long
remembered, was the “Cacafuego.” The Spanish Government estimated
the loss at a million and a half of ducats. A ducat was about two dollars.</p>

<p>Drake now determined to give up the risk of returning by the way he
came, and to go home by the north or by crossing the Pacific. He abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the hope of joining his consorts, who had, though he did not know
it, no thought of joining him. On the 16th of March he touched at the
Island of Caines, where he experienced a terrible earthquake; on the 15th
of March at Guatulco, in Mexico, where he took some fresh provisions;
and sailing the
next day, struck
northward on
the voyage in
which he discovered
the
coast of Oregon
and of that part
of California
which now belongs
to the
United States.</p>

<p>A certain
doubt hangs
over the original
discovery
of the eastern
coast of this
nation. There
is no doubt that
the coast of Oregon was discovered to Europe by the greatest seaman of
Queen Elizabeth’s reign.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Taking as plunder a potful of silver reals,&mdash;the pot, says Fletcher, “as
big as a bushel,”&mdash;and some other booty, Drake sailed west, then northwest
and north, “fourteen hundred leagues in all.” This, according to the
account of Fletcher, his chaplain, brought them to the 3d of June,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> when
they were in north latitude 42°. On the night of that day, the weather
(which had been very hot) became bitterly cold; the ropes of the ship
were stiff with ice, and sleet fell instead of rain. This cold weather continued
for days. On the fifth they ran in to a shore which they then first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
descried, and anchored in a bad bay, which was the best roadstead they
could find. But the moment the gale lulled, “thick stinking fogs” settled
down on them; they could not abide there; and from this place<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> they
turned south, and ran along the coast. They found it “low and reasonable
plain.” Every hill was covered with snow, though it was in June.</p>

<p>In the latitude of 38° 30′, they came to a “convenient and fit harbour.”
Another narrator says, “It pleased God to send us into a fair and good
bay, with a good wind to enter the same.” They entered, and remained
in it till the 23d of July. During all this time they were visited with the
“like nipping colds.” They would have been glad to keep their beds, and
if they were not at work, would have worn their winter clothes. For a
fortnight together they could take no observations of sun or star. When
they met the natives, they found them shivering even under their furs;
and the “ground was without greenness” and the trees without leaves
in June and July.</p>

<p>The day after they entered this harbor an Indian came out to them in
a canoe. He made tokens of respect and submission. He threw into the
ship a little basket made of rushes containing an herb called <i>tobàh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Drake wished to recompense him, but he would take nothing but a hat,
which was thrown into the water. The company of the “Pelican” supposed
then and always that the natives considered and reverenced them
as gods. In preparation for repairing the ship, Drake landed his stores.
A large company of Indians approached as he landed, and friendly relations
were maintained between them and the Englishmen during the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of their stay. Drake received them cautiously but kindly. He set up
tents, and built a fort for his defence. The natives, watching the English
with amazement, still regarded them as gods. One is tempted to connect
this superstition with the direct claim which Alarcon had made of a divine
origin, in presence of these tribes, a generation before, though at a point
five hundred miles away. Fletcher’s description of their houses is precisely
like the Spaniard’s account of the winter houses of the tribes he
met. “Those houses are digged round within the earth, and have from the
uppermost brimmes of the circle clefts of wood set up, and joined close
together at the top like our spires on the steeple of a church; which, being
covered with earth, suffer no water to enter, and are very warm; the door
in the most part of them performs the office also of a chimney to let out
the smoke; it’s made in bigness and fashion like to an ordinary scuttle in
a ship, and standing slopewise.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>At the end of two days an immense assembly, called together from all
parts of the country, gathered to see the strangers. They brought with
them feathers and bags of <i>tobàh</i> for presents or for sacrifices. Arrived at
the top of the hill, their chief made a long address, wearying his English
hearers and himself. When he had concluded, the rest, bowing their bodies
in a dreamy manner “and long producing of the same,” cried “Oh!” giving
their consent to all that had been spoken. This reminds one of the “hu”
of the Indians of the Tizon. The women, meanwhile, tore their cheeks
with their nails, and flung themselves on the ground, as if for a personal
bloody sacrifice. Drake met this worship, not as Alarcon had done, but
by calling his company to prayer. The men lifted their eyes and hands to
heaven to signify that God was above, and besought God “to open their
blinded eyes to the knowledge of him and of Jesus Christ the salvation of
the Gentiles.” Through these prayers, the singing of psalms, and reading
certain chapters of the Bible, Fletcher, who was the chaplain, says they sat
very attentively. They observed every pause, and cried “Oh!” with one
voice, greatly enjoying our exercises. They thus showed a more catholic
spirit than the whites had shown, who were wearied by the length of the
address of the savages. Drake made them presents, which at the departure
of the English they returned, saying that they were sufficiently rewarded
by their visit.</p>

<p>The fame of this visit extended so far, that at the end of three days
more, on the 26th of June, a larger company assembled. This time the
king himself, with a body-guard of one hundred warriors, was with them.
They called him their <i>Hióh</i>. He approached the English, preceded by a
mace-bearer, who carried two feather crowns, with three chains of bone
of marvellous length, often doubled. Such chains were of the highest estimation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and only a few persons were permitted to wear them. The number
of chains, indeed, marked the rank of the highest nobility, some of whom
wore as many as twenty. Next to the mace-bearer came the king himself.
On his head was a knit crown somewhat like those which were borne before
him. He wore a coat of the skins of conies coming to his waist. His guards
wore similar coats, and some of them wore cauls upon their heads, covered
with a certain vegetable down, almost sacred, and used only by the highest
ranks. The common people followed, naked, but with feathers,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> every one
pleasing himself with his own device. The last part of the company were
women and children. Each woman brought a well-made basket of rushes.
Some of these were so tight that they would hold water. They were
adorned with pearl shells and with bits of the bone chains. In the baskets
they had bags of <i>tobàh</i> and roots called <i>petáh</i>, which they ate cooked or
raw. Drake meanwhile held his men in military array.</p>

<p>The mace-bearer then pronounced aloud a long speech, which was dictated
to him in a low voice by another. All parties, except the children,
approached the fort, and the mace-bearer began a song, with a dance to
the time, in which all the men joined. The women danced without singing.
Drake saw that they were peaceable, and permitted them to enter his
palisade. The women showed signs of the wounds which they had made
before coming, by way of preparing for the solemnity.</p>

<p>At the request of the chief, Drake then sat down. The king and others
made to him several orations, or, “indeed, supplications, that he would
take province and kingdom into his hand, and become their king and
patron.” With one consent they sang a song, placed one of the crowns
upon his head, hung their chains upon his neck, and honored him as
their <i>Hióh</i>.</p>

<p>Drake did not think he should refuse this gift. “In the name and to
the use of Queen Elizabeth, he took the sceptre, crown, and dignity of the
country into his hand.” He only wished, says the historian, that he could
as easily transport the riches and treasures wherewith in the upland it
abounds, to the enriching of her kingdom at home. Had Drake had any
real knowledge of the golden gravel over which the streams of the upland
flowed, it may well be that the history of California would have been
changed.</p>

<p>From this time, through several weeks while Drake remained there, the
multitude also remained. At first they brought offerings every three days
as sacrifices, until they learned that this displeased their English king.
Like other sovereigns who have had much to do with this race, he found
that he had to feed his red retainers. But he had mussels, seals, “and such
like,” in quantity sufficient for their rations.</p>

<p>Drake made a journey into the country. He saw “infinite company” of
fat deer, in a herd of thousands. He found a multitude of strange “conies”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in large numbers, with long tails, and with a bag under the chin in which
to carry food either for future supply or for their children.</p>

<p>Drake erected on the shore a post, on which he placed a plate of brass.
Here he engraved the Queen’s name, the date of his landing, the gift of the
country by the people, and left her Majesty’s portrait and arms. The last
were not designed by his artists, as some historians have carelessly supposed,
but were on a silver piece, of sixpence, “showing through a hole
made of purpose in the plate.”</p>

<p>When the people saw that Drake could not remain, they could not conceal
their grief. At last they stole on the English unawares with a sacrifice
which “they set on fire,” thus burning a chain and bunch of feathers. The
English could not dissuade them till they fell to prayers and singing of
psalms, when the sad natives let their fire go out, and left the sacrifice
unconsumed. On the 23d of July the friends parted, the English for the
shores of Asia, the savages to the hills, where they built fires as long as the
“Pelican” was in sight. Thus did England take possession of the region
which, after near three hundred years, proved to be the richest gold-bearing
country in the world. Drake gave to the country the name of New Albion,
and it bore that name on the maps for centuries. He called it so “for two
causes: in respect of the white banks and cliffs which lie towards the sea;
and the other because it might have some affinity with our country in
name.” Curiously enough, the original narrative says, “There is no part
of earth here to be taken up wherein there is not some speciall likelihood
of gold or silver.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>From the time when the Government’s ships crept along the coast to
Cape Mendocino, and then turned, unwilling, to their long voyage to Asia,
observations on that coast were doubtless repeated by navigators. The
line of coast took different courses and different names accordingly. But
it is well-nigh certain that from the time of Drake until 1770 the California
now a part of the United States had no European inhabitants. The part
of California which is in Mexico was first settled by Jesuit missions, whose
first successes date from the year 1697.</p>

<p>Drake returned to England by way of the Cape of Good Hope, and
arrived at Plymouth in triumph on the 26th of September, 1580. He
had given the name <span class="smcap">Nova Albion</span> to the western coast of North America
thus discovered; he had taken possession for his sovereign, Elizabeth,
with better color of right than most discoverers could urge. But under this
title the Queen never claimed, nor her successors indeed, until, after three
centuries, Drake’s voyage may have been sometimes cited as a vague or
shadowy introduction to any rights by which England claimed the mouth
of the Columbia River and the region northward.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The name <span class="smcap">Nova Albion</span> was generally applied on the maps to the more
northerly region, the Oregon of our geography. But the name <span class="smcap">California</span>
held its place for the whole region known to us as the State of California,
as well as for the peninsula and the gulf. The distinction between
Upper and Lower California is still observed.</p>

<p>Drake’s reception at home was an enthusiastic one, by a populace always
anxious for a hero. It was tempered somewhat by the cautious feelings of
some, who regarded with no favorable eye the policy of private reprisals
upon another nation in time of peace. The Queen had no such compunctions.
She received him with undisguised favor, dined with him on board
his ship, and made him a knight. She directed that the vessel which had
borne her authority about the world should be carefully preserved; and
when the ship was finally broken up, John Davis, the Arctic navigator,
caused a chair to be made of the timbers, which is now one of the relics
of interest in the Bodleian Library, and within whose seat Abraham Cowley
wrote one of his well-known poems.</p>

<p>At length, in 1585, Queen Elizabeth determined on open hostility, and
giving Drake his first royal commission, and an ample fleet and land force,
he started on his successful expedition to the Spanish main, when town
after town fell into his hands, and the Spanish settlements experienced
most poignantly ravages similar to those which they had so abundantly for
nearly a century inflicted upon the natives of those regions. Of his subsequent
exploits in European waters this is no place for the recital; but
in 1595 he prevailed upon Elizabeth to put him, in connection with his
old patron and companion, Sir John Hawkins, once more in command
of another expedition to Spanish America. They sailed from Plymouth
in August, with the purpose of seizing Nombre de Dios, and then of
marching his twenty-five hundred troops to Panama to capture the treasure
which took that route from Peru on its way to Spain. The expedition
was a melancholy failure. The Spaniards were forewarned. Porto
Rico successfully resisted the English in the first place, and the attack
on Panama was abortive.</p>

<p>Hawkins died, overcome by the reverses; and Drake, struck with a
fever of mortification, sank beneath the fatal influences of the climate, and
died on board his ship early in the following year. His remains were placed
in a leaden casket and sunk off Puerto Cabello, and there was no failure of
suspicions that he had been the victim of foul play. There are those in
the English nation who indulge the hope that the casket may yet be
recovered, and that the remains of the great English “Dragon” may yet
rest beneath the pavement of Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h3><a name="c74" id="c74"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON DRAKE’S BAY.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE question where was the “convenient and fit harbor,” the “fair and good bay,”
which Drake entered on the Pacific coast, and where he careened and repaired the
“Pelican,” is still undecided, after much discussion by the Californian geographers, who
have now their capital in the city of San Francisco,&mdash;on that matchless land-locked
harbor which is entered by the narrow passage known as the “Golden Gate.” The
authorities are not many, and are not quite in accord.</p>

<p>The narrative of Fletcher, which has been followed in the text, gives the latitude of
this bay as 38° 30′ north. But the briefer narrative in Hakluyt<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> says: “We came within
thirty-eight degrees towardes the line; in which height it pleased God to send us into
a faire and good bay, with a good wind to enter the same.” Here is a difference of half a
degree. But the text in Hakluyt is supported by a manuscript marginal note on what
seems to be the original drawing of Dudley’s map, and which is preserved in Munich,
where the language (Italian) is: “This map begins with the port of New Albion, in
longitude 237° and latitude 38°, discovered by the Englishman Drake in 1579 or thereabout,
as above,&mdash;a convenient place to water and to collect other
refreshment.” The manuscript has a note, which the engraving has
not, “Porto bonissimo.” But on the coast farther north, where the
same author speaks of the cold, he says: “Drake returned to 38½
degrees, and the weather was temperate, and he called it New Albion.”
The <i>Arcano del Mare</i>, in which these maps are printed, was
not published till 1646. But Dudley, the author, was active in maritime
affairs in England in all the last ten years of the sixteenth
century. He was the son of Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester;
he was brother-in-law of Cavendish, administered on his estate,
and must have seen his chart.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Hakluyt had wished to publish
his narrative of Drake in his edition of 1589; but
this account by Pretty was not regularly embodied
by Hakluyt in his great work till 1600.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The <i>World
Encompassed</i> was not printed until 1628, but is
from Fletcher’s contemporary notes. Dudley himself
prepared an expedition to the South Seas.
He may be spoken of as a valuable contemporary
authority. The English Government did not publish
such discoveries. But Cavendish would have
had Drake’s charts.</p>

<p>Now the opening of the Golden Gate is in
latitude 37° 46′: it exactly corresponds with “within
38° N.” of one account, but it lacks 44′ of the
38° 30′ of the other two. The discrepancy is not so important when we find that in 38° 30′
there is no harbor and no bay, good or bad. The voyager must come down the coast as
far as 38° 15′ to find Bodega Bay, which has, accordingly, been assigned by some conjectures
as Sir Francis’ resting-place. Just south of this, near the line of 38°, is an open
roadstead which has some advocates in this discussion. Between this bay and the Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Gate, the point of Los Reyes runs out southwest. East of this, and northwest of the
Golden Gate, is another open roadstead, facing the south, which for many years, long
before the discovery of Californian gold, had been known as Jack’s Bay, or Sir Francis
Drake’s Bay. One of these four bays
is chosen by one or another geographer
as the fair and good harbor into which
a special providence drove Drake by a
favorable wind.</p>

at Washington.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this discussion, the map of Dudley,
whose information was nearly at first-hand,
plays an important part. His representation
of Drake’s bay&mdash;a sort of bottle-shaped
harbor&mdash;so far resembles the double bay of
San Francisco, that it would probably decide
the question, but that, unfortunately, he gives
two such bays. His two maps, also, do not very
closely resemble each other. It becomes necessary
to suppose that one of his bays was that which
we know as Bodega Bay, or that both are drawn
from the imagination. The map of Hondius gives a
chart of Drake’s bay,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> which has, unfortunately, no
representation to any bay on the coast, and is purely
imaginary.</p>

<p>The discussion is complicated from the fact, that, if
Drake entered San Francisco Bay, the English Government
kept its secret so well that they forgot it themselves.
What is curious is, that for two centuries the Spaniards
were seeking at intervals for “Port St. Francisco,” and did
not find it. In 1603, Viscaino put into a bay which he
called Port St. Francisco; but it is urged<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> that Viscaino
really entered the Bay of Monterey. The Spaniards by this
time were eagerly seeking a bay of refuge for their Asiatic
squadrons.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> They knew that Drake had repaired a vessel
somewhere. Viscaino passed “Port St. Francisco” in a
gale, and returned into it, according to the narrative. It
was not until 1769 that a land party of Franciscan monks
finally discovered to Spain the magnificent Bay of San
Francisco. One theory is that no one ever discovered it before; but a contemporary
manuscript account of the discovery, preserved in the British Museum, says distinctly
that this famous port, according to the signs given by history, is called San Francisco.
It is distant from St. Diego two hundred leagues, and is to be found in 38½°. “They say
it is the best bay they have discovered; and while it might shelter all the navies in
Europe, it is entered by a straight of three leagues, and surrounded with mountains which
make the waters tranquil.”</p>

<p>The reader must understand that all the maps had a port of Sir Francis, or a Puerto
San Francisco, or some similar name. One English map bravely says,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> “Port Sr. Francis
Drake, <i>not</i> St. Francisco,” for the bay discovered in 1770.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc200">JEFFERYS’ SKETCH.</p>

<p>So soon as this discovery was known in England, Captain
Burney claimed it as Drake’s bay; in America, Davidson, in
the <i>Coast Pilot</i>, and Mr. Greenhow give the same decision.</p>

<p>Probably the early maps must be taken as the best and
decisive authorities.</p>

<p>The reader has before him Dudley’s two maps. Of these,
Dudley says that California was drawn by an English pilot. In
his text describing the shore, he goes no further than Cape St.
Lucas, and then crosses to California, which suggests that he is
following Cavendish, who took this course, and who was Dudley’s
near kinsman. On the margin in the manuscript of Dudley’s
map at Munich, he calls Drake’s bay
“Porto bonissimo,” “the best of harbors,”&mdash;an
expression which certainly
does not belong to Jack’s Bay. In
both maps, also, it is represented as
the southern of the two deep bays, of
which the northern appears to correspond
to Bodega Bay, and the southern
to San Francisco Bay. On the larger
of the two maps Drake’s bay is placed
in the same relation to Monterey as
is held by San Francisco.</p>

position is given to Tiguex in Hondius’s map. Of this the scale is so small that Drake’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

his homeward track.</p>

points involved in the problem. It will not be long, probably, before the question is

<p class="pc1 mid">ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">FOR the authoritative accounts of William
Hawkins’s Brazilian voyages, we must go
to Hakluyt’s third volume, as published in 1600.
In it likewise we shall find the account of the
West Indian voyages of Sir John Hawkins in
1562, 1564, and 1567-68. We may also read
them in the usual compilations drawn from Hakluyt,
among the latest of which is <i>The Elizabethan
Seamen</i> of Payne, who remarks that
“nothing which Englishmen had done in connection
with America previous to those voyages
had any result worth recording.” Lowndes, in
his <i>Bibliographer’s Manual</i>, gives an edition, in
1569 (London), of John Hawkins’s <i>True Declaration
of the Troublesome Voyages to the Partes of
Guynea and the West Indies</i>; but Sabin (<i>Dictionary</i>,
viii. 157) thinks it was only printed in

<p class="pf200">A fac-simile of the original engraving is given in Gay’s <i>Popular History of the United States</i>, ii. 577.
It has a Latin legend beneath it, which reads: “The inhabitants of Nova Albion lament the departure of
Drake, now twice crowned, and by frequent sacrifices lacerate themselves.” A curious picture representing
the crowning of Drake is in the 1671 edition of Montanus, p. 213.</p>

<p class="pf200">A writer in the <i>San Francisco Evening Bulletin</i>, Oct. 5, 1878, says that the island in the sketch is misplaced,
if Bodega Bay is intended, being below the peninsula; but that, viewed from the position assigned to
Drake’s ship, it seems to be outside, as drawn. He maintains that this bay answers all the other conditions of
Fletcher’s description, and that Hondius’s sketch is confirmed by Dudley’s map.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For Drake the material is more
abundant. Regarding his famous
voyage round the world in 1577-80,
the earliest statement in print is one
said to be by Francis Pretty, and
called <i>The famous Voyage of Sir
Francis Drake into the South Sea
... begun in the yeare of our Lord 1577</i>.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Hakluyt
had this, and says in effect, in the Introduction
of his 1589 edition, that the friends
of Drake who did not wish their publications
forestalled, had wished him to omit it. Hakluyt,
however, seems to have privately printed
it, in six pages, and these, without pagination,
are found in some, if not all, copies of the
1589 volume, inserted after page 643.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> It
finally publicly appeared in his third volume
of the 1598-1600 edition. A more authoritative
publication, however, was <i>The World Encompassed
by Sir Francis Drake, carefully Collected out
of the notes of Master Francis Fletcher, Preacher
in this imployment, and divers others his followers</i>,
London, 1628.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It was reprinted in 1635,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and

It was again reprinted by the Hakluyt Society in
1855, with an Introduction by W. S. W. Vaux.
This and other accounts of the voyage have also
found a place in the general collections of Hakluyt,
Harris, and the Oxford Voyages.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The report of Da Silva mentions that Drake
captured some sea-charts from the Spaniards
during this voyage; and Kohl (<i>Catalogue of
Maps in Hakluyt</i>, p. 82) supposes that
Drake had with him the maps of Mercator
and Ortelius. After Drake’s return,
Hondius made a map of the world, in which he
tracked both the routes of Drake and Cavendish;
and of that portion showing New Albion,
as well as of his little plan of Drake’s Bay,
sketches are given herewith. Kohl thinks (page
84) that Hondius may have used Drake’s own
charts in this little marginal sketch, while the
main map has “little to do with Drake’s own
charts.” Hondius, however, is thought to have
been living in England at this
time. Molineaux is known to
have used Drake’s reports and
perhaps his map, in making
his mappemonde of 1600, of
which
an outline
sketch
of a part of
the Pacific coast
is annexed.
This is the map
mentioned by
Mr. Hale as supposed
to be referred
to by
Shakespeare.</p>

the sea betweene the west part of America and the east of Asia (which hath bene ordinarily set out

of 38°, and that the distance betweene Cape Mendocino and Cape California, which many maps

the right-hand upper corner of the map. Gali (or Gaulle), in returning from China in 1583, had
struck the California coast at 37° 30´. His account appeared in Linschoten, and so was rendered
in the English translation of Linschoten, 1598, and is given in Hakluyt, vol. iii. (1600) p. 442.]<br />

<p class="pc1 mid">EXPLORATIONS TO THE NORTH-WEST.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY CHARLES C. SMITH,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Treasurer of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE fresh spirit of maritime adventure which marked the last decade
of the fifteenth century and the first quarter of the sixteenth century,
owed its origin to mistaken theories as to the distance between the west of
Europe and the east of Asia. Columbus believed that the land which he
first discovered was an island on the coast of Japan; and he seems never to
have relinquished this idea. The contemporary geographers all cherished
the same mistake; and the early maps give a much better representation of
the coast-line of Asia than they do of the shores of North America.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> It is
a curious fact that the true position and form of South America were familiar
to cartographers long before there was any exact knowledge of the
northern half of the continent. North America was regarded as an island
or a collection of islands, through which it would not be difficult to find
a short passage to Zipangu and Cathay,&mdash;the modern Japan and China.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
Gradually these mistakes yielded to more correct views; but it was still believed
that a feasible passage existed around the northern shore of the new
continent. This belief was the inspiring motive of all the early northwestern
explorations, and it lingered almost to our own time, long after
every one knew that such a passage would be of no practical use. At
length the problem has been solved; but the introduction of new methods
of ocean and land trade and travel has deprived it of all but a purely scientific
and geographical interest. Meanwhile the search for a northwest passage
has developed an heroic endurance and a perseverance in surmounting
obstacles scarcely paralleled anywhere else, and has added largely to the
stores of human knowledge.</p>

<p>At the head of the long list of explorers for a northwest passage stand
the names of the Cabots; but the intricate questions as to the measure of
just fame to be assigned to father and son have been fully treated in another
chapter of this work,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and neither John nor Sebastian penetrated the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
northern waters with which our inquiry is mainly concerned. It is
enough now to recall their names as the leaders in an enterprise in which
for nearly three centuries England took a foremost part, and that so early
as 1497 John Cabot set sail in the hope of this great discovery. Within
the next half century he was followed by his son Sebastian, the Cortereals,
Cartier, and Hore, not one of whom sought to reach a high northern latitude.
It was not until Frobisher sailed on his first voyage that the real
northwest explorations can be said fairly to have begun. Since that time
more than one hundred voyages and land journeys have been undertaken
in this vain quest.</p>

<p>In two of the northwestern voyages of Martin Frobisher the discovery
of a short way to the South Sea was only a secondary object. The adventurers
at whose cost they were undertaken looked mainly to the profit from a
successful search for gold, though they were not unmindful of the advantages
to be gained by shortening the distance to the Spice Islands of the East.
In the bitter quarrel between Frobisher and Michael Lok, after the third
voyage, it was charged that Frobisher had neglected this part of the
undertaking. But it was natural that Lok, who had no doubt lost heavily
by the voyages, should be angry with Frobisher, and endeavor to make the
most of any failure on his part to carry out the whole plan; and there is no
reason to believe that Frobisher wilfully neglected the interests or the wishes
of his employers, however much they may have been disappointed. The
whole amount subscribed for the three voyages was upward of twenty thousand
pounds, and of this sum Lok subscribed, for himself and his children,
nearly one fourth. Among the subscribers were Queen Elizabeth, who
invested four thousand pounds, Lord Burleigh, the Earl and Countess of
Warwick, the Earl of Leicester, the Earl and Countess of Pembroke, Sir
Philip Sidney, Sir Thomas Gresham, Sir Francis Walsingham, and others
scarcely less conspicuous in that generation.</p>

<p>Frobisher’s first expedition consisted of two small vessels, the “Gabriel”
and the “Michael,” one of twenty-five tons and the other of twenty tons,
and a pinnace of ten tons. They set sail from Blackwall on the 15th of
June, 1576, but it was not until the 1st of July that they were clear of the
coast of England. Not long after coming in sight of Friesland, Frobisher
parted company with the pinnace, in which were four men, who were never
seen again; and about the same time the “Michael” slipped away without
any warning, and returned to England. Nevertheless, Frobisher pressed
on, and on the 21st he entered the opening now known as Frobisher’s
Strait or Bay, “having upon eyther hande a great mayne or continent;
and that land uppon hys right hande as hee sayled westward, he judged
to be the continente of Asia, and there to bee devided from the firme of
America, which lyeth uppon the lefte hande over against the same.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Into
this bay, as it is now known to be, he sailed about sixty leagues, capturing
one of the natives, whom he carried to England. The land, Meta Incognita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he took possession of in the name of the Queen of England, commanding
his company, “if by anye possible meanes they could get ashore, to bring
him whatsoever thing they could first find, whether it were living or dead,
stocke or stone, in token of Christian possession.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Some of the men
returned to him
with flowers, some
with green grass,
“and one brought
a peece of black
stone, much lyke
to a seacole in
coloure, which by
the waight seemed
to be some kinde
of mettall or mynerall.”
Frobisher
reached England
on his return in
the following October,
and on his
arrival presented
the stone to one
of his friends, an
adventurer in the
voyage. The wife
of this gentleman
accidentally threw
it into the fire,
where it remained
for some time,
when it was taken
out and quenched
in vinegar. It then appeared of a bright gold color, and on being submitted
to a goldfinder in London, was said to be rich in gold; and large
profits were promised if the ore was sufficiently abundant.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pf250">This cut follows the engraving in the Hakluyt Society’s edition of <i>Frobisher’s Voyages</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>With this report, there was little difficulty in providing means for a
second voyage. The new expedition consisted of a “tall ship of her
Majesty’s,” named the “Ayde,” of two hundred tons, and of two smaller
vessels, with the same names as those in the former voyage, but now said
to be of thirty tons each. They were manned in all by one hundred and
twenty men, to which number Frobisher was limited by his orders. After
some delay, he sailed from Harwich on the 31st of May, 1577. By his
orders he was directed to proceed at once to the place where the mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was found, and set the miners at work. There he was to leave the “Ayde,”
and then to sail to another place visited on his first voyage, where a further
attempt at mining was to be made, and where one of the small barks was to
be left. With the remaining bark he was to sail fifty or a hundred leagues
farther west, to make “certayne that you are entred into the South Sea;
and in yo<sup>r</sup> passage to learne all that you can, and not to tarye so longe
from the ‘Ayde’ and worckmen but that you bee able to retorne homewards
w<sup>th</sup> the shippes in due tyme.” If the mines should prove less productive
than it was hoped they would be, he was to “proceade towards the discovering
of Cathaya w<sup>th</sup> the two barcks, and returne the ‘Ayde’ for England
agayne.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Frobisher had his first sight of Friesland on the 4th of July;
and he reached Milford Haven, in Wales, on his return voyage, about the
23d of September. During this period of a little more than two months, his
energies were mainly devoted to procuring ore, of which, in twenty days,
he obtained nearly two hundred tons; but he also made as careful an examination
as was practicable of the region previously visited by him, and
added something to the stock of geographical knowledge. Two of the
natives were captured, and were carried to England to be educated as
interpreters.</p>

<p>Frobisher’s third voyage was planned on a much larger scale than any
other which hitherto had been sent to the Arctic regions, and he was placed
in command of fifteen vessels. They were all collected at Harwich by the
27th of May, 1578; and after receiving their instructions from Frobisher,
they sailed together on the 31st. On the 2d of July they reached the mouth
of Frobisher’s Bay; but after entering it a short distance, they found it so
choked with ice that it was impossible to proceed. One of the vessels was
soon sunk by the ice, and all suffered more or less. After beating about for
several days, they entered a strait, supposed at first to lead to their desired
goal, but which was, in fact, what is now known as Hudson’s Strait, the entrance
to the great bay which bears his name, “havyng alwayes a fayre
continente uppon their starreboorde syde, and a continuance still of an open
sea before them.” According to Best, one of the captains, and an historian
of the expedition, Frobisher was probably one of the first to discover the
mistake, though he persuaded his followers that they were in the right
course and the known straits. “Howbeit,” he adds, “I suppose he rather
dissembled his opinion therein than otherwyse, meaning by that policie
(being hymself ledde with an honorable desire of further discoverie) to
enduce y<sup>e</sup> fleete to follow him, to see a further proofe of that place. And,
as some of the company reported, he hath since confessed, that, if it had
not bin for the charge and care he had of y<sup>e</sup> fleete and fraughted shippes,
he both would and could have gone through to the South Sea, called Mare
del Sur, and dissolved the long doubt of the passage which we seeke to find
to the rich countrey of Cataya.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Toward the latter part of July it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
determined not to proceed any farther, and after many difficulties and
dangers they returned to Meta Incognita. It had been their intention to
erect a house here, and to leave a considerable party to spend the winter.
But after a full consideration it was decided that this plan was impracticable,
and it was relinquished. A house of lime and stone was, however, built
on the Countess of Warwick’s Island, in which numerous articles were
deposited. On the last day of August the fleet, having completed their
loading with more than thirteen hundred tons of ore, sailed for England,
where they arrived at various times about the 1st of October, and with the
loss of not more than forty men in all. The ore proved to be of very
little value, and the adventurers lost a large part of what they had subscribed.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Of the voyages of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who is often included among
the northwest explorers, little need be said here; for though he wrote an
elaborate <i>Discourse of a Discovery for a new Passage to Cataia</i>, to stimulate
the search for a northwest passage, the voyage in which he lost his life was
not extended beyond the coasts of Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Next in importance to the three voyages of Frobisher are the three voyages
of Captain John Davis, who has been immortalized by the magnificent
strait which bears his name, and which was discovered on his first
voyage. On this voyage he sailed from Dartmouth on the 7th of June,
1585, with two vessels,&mdash;the “Sunshine,” of fifty tons, manned by twenty-three
persons, and the “Moonshine,” of thirty-five tons, with seventeen
men. But it was not until three weeks later that he was able to take his
final departure from the Scilly Islands; and he arrived at Dartmouth, on
his return, on the 30th of September. In this brief period he made some
important discoveries, and sailed as far north as 66° 66′, and westward
farther than any one had yet penetrated, “finding no hindrance.” He naturally
concluded that he had already discovered the desired passage, and
that it was only necessary to press forward in order to insure entire success.
But he was compelled by stress of weather to put back, and he reached
England shortly afterward. On his second voyage his little fleet was increased
by the addition of the “Mermaid,” of one hundred tons, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“North Star,” a pinnace of ten tons. He sailed from Dartmouth on the 7th
of May, 1586, and for a time everything promised well; but at the end
of July the crew of his largest vessel
became discontented, and returned
with her to England. Meanwhile, the
“Sunshine” and the pinnace had been
sent to make discoveries to the eastward
of Greenland. But, in nowise
disheartened by these circumstances,
Davis determined to prosecute his
enterprise in the “Moonshine.” He
reached, however, not quite so far
north as in his previous voyage, and
apparently about as far west, and arrived
home early in October,&mdash;“not
having done so much as he did in his
first voyage,” is the judgment of one
of his successors in Arctic navigation.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>On his third voyage he sailed
from Dartmouth, on the 19th
of May, 1587, with three vessels,&mdash;the
“Elizabeth,” the
“Sunshine,” and a smaller vessel,
the “Helen,”&mdash;and arrived
at the same port, on his return,
on the 15th of September. His
course was in the track which he had
previously followed; but he added
little to the knowledge he had already
gained, and having been inadequately
provided for a long voyage, was
obliged to sail for home when he
thought “the passage is most probable,
the execution easie.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It is a matter for surprise, in view
of the sanguine expectations of Davis, that an interval of nearly fifteen years
elapsed between his return from his third voyage and the sailing of the next
expedition. This was sent out at the cost of the East India Company,
and consisted of two small vessels,&mdash;the
“Discovery,” under
the command of Captain George
Waymouth, and the “Godspeed,”
under John Drew. Waymouth
sailed from the Thames
on the 2d of May, 1602, under
a contract which provided that
he should sail directly toward
the coast of Greenland and the
sea described as Fretum Davis,
and that thence he should proceed
by those seas, “or as he
shall find the passadge best to
lye towards the parts or kingdom
of Cataya or China, or the
backe side of America, w<sup>th</sup>out
geveng ouer the proceedinge on
his course soe longe as he shall finde those seas or any ṗte thereof navigable,

spite of these specific
directions, the voyage
was not productive of
any important results,
though it is probable
that he sighted land to the north of Hudson’s Strait; and Luke Fox
appears to have been right when he says that Waymouth “neither discovered
nor named any thing more than Davis, nor had any sight of Groenland,
nor was so farre north; nor can I conceive he hath added anything
more to this designe. Yet these two, Davis and he, did (I conceive),
light Hudson into his straights.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Waymouth himself ascribed his failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to a mutiny which occurred in the latter part of July, and which compelled
him to return to Dartmouth, where he arrived on the 5th of August. An
inquiry into the causes of the failure was begun shortly afterward, but no
evidence has been found to show how it terminated.</p>

<p>Three voyages were undertaken not long afterward by the Danes, in
which James Hall was the chief pilot; and one by the English, under the
command of John Knight, in a pinnace of forty tons, sent out by the East
India and Muscovy companies. But each of these voyages had for its chief
object the discovery of gold and silver mines, and though they all seem to
have followed in the track of Frobisher, they added little or nothing to the
knowledge of Arctic geography, and contributed nothing toward the solution
of the problem of a northwest passage. The first of these expeditions,
in which both Hall and Knight were employed, consisted of two small ships
and a pinnace, and sailed from Copenhagen on the 2d of May, 1605. After
coasting along the western shore of Davis Strait as far north as 69°, the
ships reached Elsinore on their return early in August. The next year
a fleet of four ships and a pinnace was sent out, with Hall as pilot-major.
They sailed from Elsinore on the 29th of May, but were prevented by the
ice and stormy weather from reaching as far north as before, and after
much delay they returned to Copenhagen on the 4th of October. In 1607
Hall accompanied a third expedition, consisting of two vessels, which was
equally unproductive of results. When they had reached no farther than
Cape Farewell, on the southern coast of Greenland, they were compelled
to return, from causes which are variously stated, but which were probably
complicated by a mutinous spirit in the crew.</p>

<p>In the same year with Hall’s second voyage, Knight sailed from Gravesend,
on the 18th of April. Two months afterward he made land on the
coast of Labrador; and the captain and five men went on shore to find a
convenient place for repairing their vessel. Leaving two men with their
boat, the captain and three men went to the highest part of the island.
They did not return that day, and on the following day the state of the
ice was such that it was impossible to reach them, and they were never
heard from afterward. The pinnace then went to Newfoundland to repair;
and after encountering many perils, reached Dartmouth on the 24th of December.
Hall made a fourth voyage, in 1612, in two small vessels fitted
out by some merchant-adventurers in London. In this voyage he was
mortally wounded in an encounter with the Esquimaux on the coast of
Labrador. His death destroyed all hope of a successful prosecution of
the enterprise, and shortly afterward the vessels returned to England.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson had already acquired a considerable reputation as a bold
and skilful navigator, and had made three noteworthy voyages of discovery
when he embarked on his voyage for northwest exploration. On the 17th
of April, 1610, he sailed from Gravesend in the “Discovery,” a vessel of
only fifty-five tons, provisioned for six months; and on the 9th of June
he arrived off Frobisher’s Strait. He then sailed southwesterly, and entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the strait which bears his name, passed through its entire length, naming
numerous islands and headlands, and finally, on the 3d of August, saw before
him the open waters of Hudson’s Bay. Three months were spent in examining
its shores, and on the 10th of November his vessel was frozen in.
She was not released until the 18th of June in the following year, and six
days afterward a mutiny occurred. Hudson and his son, with six of the
crew who were either sick or unfit for work, were forced into a shallop,
where they were voluntarily joined by the carpenter; and then the frail
boat was cut loose, and the mutineers set sail for home, leaving their late
master and his companions to the mercy of the waves or death by starvation.
They were never seen or heard of again; but after encountering
great perils and privations, the mutineers finally made land in Galway Bay,
on the coast of Ireland. Hudson’s own account of the voyage terminates
with his entrance into the bay discovered by him. For the later explorations
and for the tragic end of the great navigator’s brilliant career, we are
forced to trust to the narrative of one of his men, Abacuk Pricket. If we
may believe the story told by him, he had no part in the mutiny; but no
one can read his narrative without sharing the suspicion of Fox: “Well,
Pricket, I am in great doubt of thy fidelity to Master Hudson.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Two years after Hudson sailed on his last voyage, a new expedition was
sent to the northwest under the command of Sir Thomas Button. It consisted
of two ships, the “Resolution” and the “Discovery,” and was provisioned
for eighteen months. “Concerning this voyage,” says Luke Fox,
“there cannot bee much expected from me, seing that I have met with
none of the Journalls thereof. It appeareth that they have been concealed,
for what reasons I know not.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Button sailed from England in the beginning
of May, and entering Hudson’s Strait, crossed the Bay to the southern
point of Southampton Island, which he named Carey’s Swan’s Nest. He
then kept on toward the western side of the Bay, to which he gave the significant
name “Hope’s Check,” and coasting along the shore he discovered
the important river which he called Port Nelson, and which is now known as
Nelson’s River. Here he wintered, “and kept three fires all the Winter, but
lost many men, and yet was supplied with great store of white Partridges
and other Fowle,” says Fox.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> On the breaking up of the ice he made a
thorough exploration of the bay and of Southampton Island, and finally
returned to England in the autumn, having accomplished enough to give
him a foremost rank among Arctic navigators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A little less than a year and a half after Button’s return, Robert Bylot
and William Baffin embarked on the first of the two voyages commonly
associated with their names.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>They sailed from the Scilly Islands on Good
Friday, April 7, 1615, in the “Discovery,” a ship of about fifty-five tons, in
which Bylot had already made three voyages to the northwest. Following
a course already familiar to him, they passed through Hudson’s Strait, and
ascended what is now known as Fox Channel. Here and at the western
end of Hudson’s Strait they spent about three
weeks, and then sailed for home, where they arrived
in the early part of September.</p>

<i>American Biography</i>, ii. 9.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Their next voyage was one of far greater interest and importance, and ranks
among the most famous of the Arctic voyages. They sailed again in the
“Discovery,” leaving Gravesend on the 26th of March, 1616, with a company
numbering in all seventeen persons; and coasting along the western
shore of Greenland and through Davis Strait, they visited and explored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
both shores of the great sea which has ever since borne the name of
Baffin’s Bay. Here they discovered and named the important channels
known as Lancaster Sound and Jones Sound, beside numerous smaller
bodies of water and numerous islands since become familiar to Arctic
voyagers. All this was accomplished in a short season, and on the 30th
of August they cast anchor at Dover on their return.</p>

<p>Fifteen years elapsed, during which no important attempt was made
toward the discovery of a northwest passage; but in 1631 two voyages
were undertaken, to one of which we owe the quaint, gossippy narrative
entitled <i>Northwest Fox, or Fox from the Northwest Passage</i>. Luke Fox,
its author, was a Yorkshireman, of keen sense and great perseverance,
as well as a skilful navigator. He had long been interested in northwest
explorations; and, according to his own account, he wished to go as mate
with Knight twenty-five years before. At length he succeeded in interesting
a number of London merchants and other persons in the enterprise,
and on the 5th of May, 1631, he set sail from Deptford in the “Charles,”
a pinnace of seventy tons, victualled for eighteen months. He searched
the western part of Hudson’s Bay, discovered the strait and shore known
as Sir Thomas Roe’s Welcome, sailed up Fox Channel to a point within
the Arctic Circle, and satisfied himself, by a careful observation of the
tides, of the existence of the long-sought passage, but failed to discover
it. On his return he cast anchor in the Downs on the 31st of October,
“not having lost one Man, nor Boy, nor Soule, nor any manner
of Tackling, having beene forth neere six moneths. All glory be to
God!”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>On the same day on which Fox began his voyage, Captain Thomas
James sailed from the Severn in a new vessel of seventy tons, named the
“Maria,” manned by twenty-two persons, and, like Fox’s vessel, victualled
for eighteen months. On his outward voyage he encountered
many perils, and on more than one occasion his vessel barely escaped
shipwreck. His explorations were confined to the waters of Hudson’s
Bay, and more particularly to its southeastern part, where he wintered on
Charlton Island. Here he built a house in which the ship’s company lived
from December until June, enduring as best they might all the horrors
of an Arctic winter on an island only a little north of the latitude of London.
On the 2d of July they again set sail, but were so hampered by ice
that their progress was very slow, and in the latter part of August
James, with the unanimous concurrence of his officers, determined to
return home. He arrived at Bristol on the 22d of October, 1632, having
added almost nothing to the knowledge gained by Fox in a third of the
time.</p>

<p>Both voyages were substantially failures, and their want of success
nearly put an end to northwestern explorations. It was more than a
hundred years before the matter was again taken up in any deliberate
and efficient manner. But in the long list of Arctic navigators there are
no greater names than those of Frobisher, Davis, Hudson, and Baffin.
With means utterly disproportioned, as it now seems, to the task which
they undertook, these men accomplished
results which have
called forth the admiration of
more than one of their successors. They did not find the new and more
direct way to Cathay which they sought for; but they dispelled many
geographical illusions, and every fresh advance in our knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Arctic regions has only confirmed the accuracy of their statements. The
story of these later explorations belongs to another part of this History;

of hardship for the solution of great geographical problems not
unworthy of the men whose voyages have been here narrated.</p>

<h3><a name="c97" id="c97"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">A COMPLETE bibliography of the northwest explorations is apart from our present
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The principal works used in the preparation of the preceding narrative
were almost all of them written by the men who were the chief actors in the scenes and
incidents described, or are based on the original journals of those men. Their general accuracy
and trustworthiness have never been challenged, and with some unimportant exceptions
the statements of the early navigators have been confirmed by their successors. The
men who first encountered the perils of those unknown seas were men of plain, straightforward
character, who told in simple and unpretentious words what they saw and did.
Some rectifications of their opinions and descriptions have, it is true, become necessary;
in part through the imperfections of the early astronomical instruments, and in part through
the difficulty, often very great, of deciding what was land and what water, even from the
most careful observation. As a general rule, the early latitudes are given too high from
the first of these causes; but the longitudes are substantially correct.</p>

<p>Of the works which are mainly compilations, the undisputed pre-eminence belongs to
Hakluyt’s <i>Voyages</i> and Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimes</i>. Hakluyt was an enthusiast with regard to
western discoveries, and he spared neither time nor labor to obtain trustworthy information
with regard to the voyages in which he took so deep an interest. His narratives of the
early voyages, so far as we have the means of verifying them, follow with almost entire
accuracy the original documents, though in a few instances he has abbreviated his originals,
apparently from motives of economy and the want of space. In these instances, however,
the republication of the narratives by the Hakluyt Society, with the learned annotations of
their thoroughly competent editors, places before the reader an exact copy of the originals.
Purchas is an authority of less importance than Hakluyt, but a similar remark will apply
to his accounts of the early voyages, though they are more abridged than Hakluyt’s. Luke
Fox prefixed to his quaint and fascinating narrative of his own voyage an account of what
had been done by his predecessors, and this must be classed among the best authorities.
Of the later compilations the <i>Chronological History</i><a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> of Sir John Barrow, so far as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
covers the earlier period, should not be overlooked by any one who wishes for a full summary
of what was accomplished. He was scarcely less of an enthusiast than was Hakluyt;
and his statements of fact are apparently indisputable. But he was a man of strong and
often of unreasonable prejudices,
and his opinions, particularly
regarding events
near his own time, cannot
always be accepted without
a careful investigation of
their grounds. The <i>Narratives</i>,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
edited by Mr. Rundall

study.</p>

<p>As an attempt to find a
practicable passage between
the Atlantic and the Pacific,
either through or around
North America, every voyage
early and late was a
failure. The theories in accordance
with which northwestern
explorations were
first undertaken were unsound,
and the objects by
which they were inspired
found realization long ago
in quite other ways. But not
the less did those theories
and those objects animate
men with a zeal and self-sacrifice
worthy of the Crusades,
and produce results of great importance. No easier route to China and Japan was
discovered to enrich the fortunate adventurers; no valuable territories were added to the
realm of England; and it was an utterly barren sovereignty which Frobisher and his successors
claimed. But for the disappointment of these expectations there was an ample
compensation in the whaling grounds to which they pointed the way, and which have

Of John Davis of Sandridge, whose exploits we are concerned with, there has sometimes
been confusion with a namesake and contemporary, John Davis of Limehouse, and Mr.
Froude has confounded them in his <i>Forgotten Worthies</i>; but a note in the Hakluyt
Society’s edition of <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>, p. lxxviii, makes clear the distinction, and is not
the least of the excellences of that book, which contains the best grouping of all that is to
be learned of Davis.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">The Zeno Influence on Early Cartography.</span>&mdash;Frobisher’s
reference to Friesland
indicates the influence which the Zeno map, then
for hardly a score of years before the geographers
of Europe, was having upon their notions
regarding the North Atlantic.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">THE ZENO CHART, <i>circa</i> 1400.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of this map and its curious history a full
account is given in Vol. I. of the present History.
It had been brought to light in Italy in
1558, and Frobisher is said to have taken it with
him on his voyage. Its errors in latitude deceived
that navigator. When he fell in with
the Greenland shore, in 61°, he supposed himself
to be at the southern limit of Friesland, that being
Zeno’s latitude for that point (the southern point
of his Greenland being in 66°); and thus that
unaccountable insular region of the Zeno chart
was put anew into the maps of the North Atlantic,
and remained there for some time. Again,
when Davis fell in with land in 61°, he thought
it neither Friesland nor Zeno’s Greenland, but
a new country, which he had found and which he
named “Desolation;” and so it appears in Molineaux’s
map and globe, and in Hudson’s map
(given in fac-simile in Asher’s <i>Henry Hudson</i>),
as an island south of Greenland, with a misplaced
Frobisher’s Straits (still misplaced as
late as the time of Hondius) separating it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Greenland. Our Zeno chart must be interpreted
by the following key:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Engronelant (Greenland).<br />
2. Grolandia.<br />
3. Islanda (Iceland).<br />
4. Norvegia (Norway).<br />
5. Estland (Shetland Islands?).<br />
6. Icaria.<br />
7. Frisland (Faroe Islands?).<br />
8. Estotiland (Labrador?).<br />
9. Drogeo (Newfoundland or New England?).<br />
10. Podalida.<br />
11. Scocia (Scotland).<br />
12. Mare et terre incognite.<br />
</p>

<p>Its influence can be further traced, twenty years
later, in the map of the world which Wolfe, in
1598, added to his English translation of Linschoten.
We annex a sketch-map of the Arctic
portion, which needs to be interpreted by the
key below the cut.</p>

<p>Considering the doubt attached to the Zeno
chart, it would seem that the earliest undoubted
delineation of American parts of the Arctic
land is the representation of Greenland which
appears in the Ptolemy of 1482. This position
of Greenland was reproduced, about ten
years before Frobisher’s voyage, in Olaus Magnus’s
Latin <i>Historia</i>, Basil, 1567, who puts on
the peninsula this legend: “Hic habitant Pygmei
vulgo Screlinger dicti.” There had been
an earlier Latin edition of the <i>Historia</i> at
Rome in 1555, and one in Italian at Venice in
1565: there was no English edition till 1658.
(<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p. 269.) Ziegler’s
<i>Schondia</i> had in Frobisher’s time been for forty
years or more a source of information regarding
the most northern regions. (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, pp. 103, 120, for editions of 1532 and
1536.)</p>

<p>The cartographical ideas of the North from
the earliest conceptions may be traced in the
following maps, which for this purpose may be
deemed typical: In 1510-12, in the Lenox Globe,
which is drawn in Dr. De Costa’s chapter; the
map in Sylvanus’s <i>Ptolemy</i>, 1511, represents
Greenland as protruding from the northwest
of Europe; the globe of Orontius Fine, 1531,
is resolvable into a similar condition, as shown
on page 11 of the present volume; Mercator’s
great map of 1569, blundering, mixes the Zeno
geography with the later developments; Gilbert’s
map, 1576, gives an insular Greenland of a
reversed trend of coast; the Lok map of 1582
may be seen on page 40, and the Hakluyt-Martyr
map on page 42. The map of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
showing the Arctic Sea which appears in Boterus’s
<i>Welt-beschreibung</i>, 1596, and Acosta’s
map (1598) of Greenland and adjacent parts,
can be compared with Wolfe’s, in Linschoten,
already given in this note. Finally, we may take
the Hondius maps of 1611 and 1619, in which
Hondius places at 80° north this legend: “Glacis
ab Hudsono detecta.”</p>


<p><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Frobisher’s Voyages.</span>&mdash;George Beste’s
<i>True Discourse of Discoverie by the North
Weast</i>, 1578, covers the three voyages, and contains
two maps,&mdash;one a mappemonde, the most
significant since Mercator’s, and of which in
part a fac-simile is here given. The other is
of Frobisher’s Straits alone. Kohl, <i>Catalogue
of Maps mentioned in Hakluyt</i>, p. 18, traces the
authorship of these charts to James Beare, Frobisher’s
principal surveyor. Compare it with
Lok’s map, page 40, of the present volume.</p>

<p>Beste’s book is very rare, and copies are
in the Lenox and Carter-Brown libraries. It is
reprinted by Hakluyt.</p>

<p>Beste’s general account may be supplemented
by these special narratives:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Voyage.</i> A State-paper given by Collinson,
“apparently by M. Lok.” The narrative
by Christopher Hall, the master, in Hakluyt.
See an examination of its results in <i>Contemporary
Review</i> (1873), xxi. 529, or <i>Eclectic Review</i>,
iii. 243.</p>

<p><i>Second Voyage.</i> Dionysius Settle’s account,
published separately in 1577. <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, no. 206, with fac-simile of title. It was
reprinted by Mr. Carter-Brown (50 copies) in
1869. See notice by J. R. Bartlett in <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1869, p. 363. This narrative
is given in Hakluyt, vol. iii.; Pinkerton,
vol. xii.; Brydge’s <i>Restituta</i>, 1814, vol. ii. Chippin’s
French version of Settle, <i>La Navigation
du Cap. Martin Forbisher</i>, was printed in 1578.
It is in the Lenox and Carter-Brown libraries.
It has reappeared at various dates, 1720, 1731,
etc. From this French version of Settle was
made the Latin, <i>De Martini Forbisseri Angli
navigatione in regiones occidentis et septentrionis,
narratio historica ex Gallico sermone in Latinum
translata per D. Joan Tho. Freigium</i>, Norbergæ,
1580, 44 leaves. This is also in the Lenox,
Carter-Brown, and Sparks (Cornell University)
Collections. Cf. <i>Sunderland Catalogue</i>, ii. 4,650.
Its value is from $10 to $30. It was reprinted
with notes at Hamburg in 1675. Stevens,
<i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. 33. Brinley, no. 28. Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>,

priced at $12 or $15. There are also German
(1580, 1679, etc.) and Dutch (1599, 1663, 1678;
in Aa’s Collection, 1706) editions. In the 1580
German edition is a woodcut of the natives
brought to England. <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, ii. 556.</p>

<p><i>Third Voyage.</i> Thomas Ellis’s narrative,
given by Hakluyt and Collinson. Edward Sellman’s
account is also given by Collinson.</p>

<p>Collinson’s life of Frobisher, prefixed to his
volume, is brief; his authorities, other than
those in the body of his book, are Fuller’s
<i>Worthies of England</i>, and such modern treatises
as Campbell’s <i>Lives of the Admirals</i>,
Barrow’s <i>Naval Worthies</i>, Muller’s <i>History of
Doncaster</i>, etc. S. G. Drake furnished a memoir,
with a good engraving of the usual portrait,
in <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, vol. iii.;
and there is a <i>Life</i> by F. Jones, London, 1878.
Biddle, in his <i>Cabot</i>, chap. 12, epitomizes the
voyages, and they can be cursorily followed
in Fox Bourne’s <i>English Seamen</i>, and Payne’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<i>Elizabethan Seamen</i>. Commander Becher, in his
paper in the <i>Journal</i> of the Royal Geographical
Society, xii. 1, gives a useful map of the Straits,
a part of which is reproduced in the accompanying
cut. In the same volume of the <i>Journal</i>
its editor enumerates the various manuscript
sources, most of which have been printed, and
have been referred to above.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Hudson’s Voyages.</span>&mdash;The sources of
our information on this navigator’s four voyages
to the North are these:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First voyage</i> in 1607, under the auspices of
the Muscovy Company, to the Northeast. A log-book,
in which Hudson may have had a hand,
or to which he may have supplied facts; and a
few fragments of his own journal. Purchas’s
<i>Pilgrims</i>, vol. iii.; Asher’s <i>Henry Hudson</i>, pp. i
and 145.</p>

<p><i>Second voyage</i>, 1608, under the auspices of
the Muscovy Company, to the Northeast. A log-book
by Hudson himself. Purchas’s <i>Pilgrims</i>,
iii. 574; <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. 81; Asher’s
<i>Hudson</i>, p. 23.</p>

<p>A map by Hondius illustrating the first and
second voyage, and given by Asher in fac-simile,
was originally published in Pontanus’s <i>History
of Amsterdam</i>, Latin ed. 1611, and Dutch ed.
1614.</p>

<p><i>Third voyage</i>, 1609, under the auspices of
the East India Company, to the Northeast, where,
foiled by the ice, he turned and sailed to make
explorations between the coast of Maine and
Delaware Bay. The journal of Juet, his companion.
Purchas’s <i>Pilgrims</i>, vol. iii.; Asher’s
<i>Hudson</i>, p. 45. See further in Mr. Fernow’s
chapter in Vol. IV. of this History.</p>

<p><i>Fourth voyage</i>, 1610, to the Northwest, discovering
Hudson’s Strait and Hudson’s Bay.
Purchas, <i>Pilgrims</i>, vol. iii., got his account from
Sir Dudley Digges. He also gives an abstract of
Hudson’s journal (Asher, p. 93); a discourse by
Pricket, one of the crew, whom Purchas discredits,
which is largely an apology for the mutiny
which set Hudson adrift in an open boat in
the bay now bearing his name (Asher, p. 98); a
letter from Iceland, May 30, 1610, perhaps by
Hudson himself, and an account of Juet’s trial
(Asher, p. 136). Purchas added some new facts
in his <i>Pilgrimage</i>, reprinted in Asher, p. 139.</p>

<p>H. Gerritsz seized the opportunity, occasioned
by the interest in Hudson’s voyage and
his fate, to promulgate his views of the greater
chance of finding a northwest passage to India,
rather than a northeast one; and in the little
collection of tracts edited by him, produced first
in the Dutch edition of 1612, he gives but a
very brief narrative of Hudson’s voyage, which
is printed on the reverse of the map showing his
discoveries,&mdash;the maps, which he gives, both of
the world and of the north parts of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
being the chief arguments of his book, the
latter map being also reproduced by Asher.
The original Dutch edition is extremely scarce,
but four or five copies being known. A reproduction
of it in 1878 by Kroon, through the
photo-lithographic process, consists of 200 copies,
and contains also, under the general title of <i>Detectio
freti Hudsoni</i>, a reproduction of the Latin
edition of 1613, with an English version by F. J.
Millard, and an Introductory Essay on the origin
and design of this collection, which, besides
Gerritsz’s tract, includes others by Massa and De
Quir. Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, viii. 33,489; Asher’s
<i>Hudson</i>, p. 267.</p>

<p>In the enlarged Latin translation, ordinarily
quoted as the <i>Detectio freti Hudsoni</i> of 1612,
Gerritsz inverted the order of the several tracts,
giving more prominence to Hudson, as May’s
expedition to the northeast had in the mean
time returned unsuccessful. <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, ii.
744, shows better than <i>Brunet</i>, iii. 358, the difference
between this 1612 and the 1613 editions.
H. C. Murphy’s <i>Henry Hudson in Holland</i>. The
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 131, gives this little
quarto the following title: <i>Descriptio ac delineatio
Geographica detectionis freti sive, Transitus ad
Occasum, suprà terras Americanas in Chinam
atq: Iaponem ducturi, Recens investigati ab M.
Henrico Hudsono Anglo</i>, etc., and cites the world
in two hemispheres as among the three maps
which it contains. A copy in Mr. Henry C.
Murphy’s collection has a second title, which
shows that Vitellus and not Gerritsz made the
Latin translation. This other title reads: <i>Exemplar
Libelli ... super Detectione quintæ Orbis
terrarum partiscui Australiæ Incognitæ nomen est:
item Relatio super Freto per M. Hudsonum Anglum
quæsito, ac in parte dedecte supra Provincias Terræ
Novæ, novæque Hispaniæ, Chinam, et Cathaiam
versus ducturo ... Latine versa ab R. Vitellio, Amstelodami
ex officina Hessilii Gerardi. Anno 1612</i>.
Speaking of this little tract and the share which
Gerritsz had in it, Asher, in his <i>Henry Hudson
the Navigator</i>, says, “Around it grew in a very
remarkable manner the most interesting of the
many collections of voyages and travels printed
in the early part of the sixteenth century.”</p>

<p>In a second Latin edition, 1613, Gerritsz
again remodelled his additions, and gave a further
account of May’s voyage. <i>Huth Catalogue</i>,
ii. 744; <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 152; Tièle,
<i>Mémoire bibliographique</i>, 1867, no. 153; Muller’s
<i>Essai d’une bibliographie néerlando-russe</i>, 1859,
p. 71.</p>

<p>To some copies of this second edition Gerritsz
added a short appendix of two leaves, Sig.
G, which is reprinted in the Kroon reproduction,
and serves to make some bibliographers reckon
a third Latin edition. There are in the Lenox
Library six copies of the original, representing
the different varieties of the Dutch and Latin
texts. One of the copies in Harvard College
Library has these two additional leaves, which
are also in the copy in the Carter-Brown Library,
whose <i>Catalogue</i>, ii. 152, says that the fac-simile
reprint by Muller must have been made from a
copy with different cuts and ornamental capitals
and tail-pieces, as these are totally different from
those of the Carter-Brown copy. The map of
the world was repeated in this edition.</p>

<p>The original Dutch text has been reprinted
in several later collections of voyages, published
in Holland. The English translation in Purchas
is incomplete and incorrect; and that of Millard,
as well as the English generally in the Kroon
reprint, could have been much bettered by a
competent native proof-reader.</p>

<p>German versions appeared in De Bry and
in Megiser’s <i>Septentrio novantiquus</i>, p. 438, both
in 1613; and in 1614 in Hulsius, part xii.</p>

<p>There is a French translation in the <i>Receuil
d’Arrests</i> of 1720.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">SIR WALTER RALEGH: THE SETTLEMENTS AT ROANOKE AND
VOYAGES TO GUIANA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY WILLIAM WIRT HENRY,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Third Vice-President of the Virginia Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">HISTORY has recorded the lives of few men more renowned than
Walter Ralegh,&mdash;the soldier, the sailor, the statesman, the courtier,
the poet, the historian, and the philosopher. The age in which he lived, the
versatility of his genius, his conspicuous services, and “the deep damnation
of his taking off,” all conspired to exalt his memory among men, and to
render it immortal. Success often crowned his efforts in the service of his
country, and the impress of his genius is clearly traced upon her history;
but his greatest service to England and to the world was his pioneer effort
to colonize America, in which he
experienced the most mortifying
defeat. Baffled in his endeavor to
plant the English race upon this
continent, he yet called into existence a spirit of enterprise which first gave
Virginia, and then North America, to that race, and which led Great Britain,
from this beginning, to dot the map of the world with her colonies, and
through them to become the greatest power of the earth.</p>

<p>Walter Ralegh<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> was born, in 1552, in the parish of Budleigh, in Devonshire.
His father was Walter Ralegh, of Fardel, and his mother was
Catherine, daughter of Sir Philip Champernown, of Modbury, and widow
of Otho Gilbert, of Compton, in Devonshire. On his mother’s side
he was brother to Sir John, Sir Humphrey, and Sir Adrian Gilbert,&mdash;all
eminent men. He studied at Oxford with great success, but he
left his books in 1569 to volunteer with his cousin, Henry Champernown,
in aid of the French Protestants in their desperate struggle for religious
liberty under the Prince of Condé and Admiral Coligny. He reached
France in time to be present at the battle of Moncontour, and remained
six years, during which time the massacre of St. Bartholomew occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Afterward he served in the Netherlands with Sir John Norris under William
of Orange in his struggle with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>In these wars he became not only an accomplished soldier, but a determined
foe to Roman Catholicism and to the Spanish people. His contest
with Spain, thus early begun, ended only with his life. It was indeed a
war to the death on both sides. Elizabeth, his great sovereign, with all
the courage of a hero in the bosom of a woman, sustained him in the conflict,
and had the supreme satisfaction of seeing him administer a death-blow
to Spanish power at Cadiz; while her pusillanimous successor rendered
himself forever infamous by putting such a conqueror to death at the mandate
of the Spanish King.</p>

</div>

<p>The claim of Spain to the New World, based upon its discovery by
Columbus, fortified by a grant from Pope Alexander VI. and further
strengthened by continued exploration and by settlements, was disputed, at
least as regards the northern continent, by England on the strength of the
Cabot voyages, of which an account has been given in the opening chapter
of this volume. The English claimed that they were entitled to North
America by the right of Cabot’s discovery of its mainland preceding that of
Columbus, who had not then touched the mainland at the south. No serious
effort was made, however, to follow up this claim by a settlement till 1578,
when Elizabeth granted to Sir Humphrey Gilbert a charter looking to a
permanent occupation of the country. Sir Humphrey sailed in November,
1578, with seven ships and three hundred and fifty men. One of the fleet,
the “Falcon,” was commanded by Ralegh, who had already learned to be a
sailor as well as a soldier. His presence with the expedition was not alone
due to his attachment to his distinguished brother. He had already discovered
that the power of Spain was due to the wealth she derived from
her American possessions, and he earnestly desired to secure for England
the same source of power. His attention had been attracted to the coast
of Florida by Coligny, whose colony of Huguenots there had been brutally
murdered by the Spaniards under Menendez in 1565.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The voyage of Gilbert met with disaster. In a short time all the
ships except Ralegh’s were forced to return. Ralegh determined to sail
for the West Indies, but when he had gone as far as the Islands of Cape
de Verde, upon the coast of Africa, he was forced by a scarcity of provisions
to return. He arrived at Plymouth in May, 1579, after having
experienced many dangerous adventures in storms and sea-fights.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey had returned before him, and was busy preparing for a
renewal of the voyage; but an Order from the Privy Council, April 26,
prohibited their departure. The conflicts at sea seem to have been with
Spanish vessels, and complaints had been made to the Council concerning
them.</p>

<p>Ralegh spent but little time in vain regrets, but at once took service in
Ireland, where he commanded a company of English soldiers employed to
suppress the insurrection headed by the Earl of Desmond, who led a mongrel
force of Spaniards, Italians, and Irishmen. His service began under the
Lord Justice Pelham, and was continued under his successor, Lord Grey.
His genius and courage soon attracted public notice, and won for him the
favor of the Queen. Upon his return in 1582 he made his appearance at
court, and at once became that monarch’s favorite. No one could have
been better fitted to play the <i>rôle</i> of courtier to this clever, passionate, and
capricious woman. Ralegh is described by a contemporary as having “a
good presence in a handsome and well-compacted person; a strong natural
wit, and a better judgment; with a bold and plausible tongue, whereby he
could set out his parts to the best advantage.” He had the culture of a
scholar and the fancy of a poet, as well as the chivalry of a soldier; and he
superadded to these that which was equally as attractive to his mistress,&mdash;unrivalled
splendor in dress and equipage.</p>

<p>The Queen’s favor soon developed into magnificent gifts of riches and
honor. He was given the monopolies of granting license for the export of
broadcloths, and for the making of wines and regulating their prices. He
was endowed with the fine estates in five counties forfeited to the Crown by
the attainder of Anthony Babington, who plotted the murder of Elizabeth
in the interest of Mary of Scotland; and with twelve thousand acres in Ireland,
part of the land forfeited by the Earl of Desmond and his followers.
He was made Lord Warden of the Stannaries, Lieutenant of the County
of Cornwall, Vice-Admiral of Cornwall and Devon, and Captain of the
Queen’s Guard.</p>

<p>One of his Irish estates was near the home of Edmund Spenser, secretary
to Lord Grey during the Irish rebellion, and a visit which led to a renewal
of their friendship led also to the publication, at the instance of Ralegh, of
the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, in which Elizabeth is represented as Belphœbe.</p>

<p>No sooner did Ralegh find that his fortune was made, than he determined
to accomplish the object of his passionate desire,&mdash;the English colonization
of America. He furnished one of the little fleet of five ships with which
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed June 11, 1583, upon his last and most disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
voyage to America, and was only prevented from going with him
by the peremptory order of the Queen, who was unwilling that her favorite
should incur the risk of any “dangerous sea-fights.” The gallant Sir
Humphrey, after taking formal possession of Newfoundland, sailed southward,
but, experiencing a series of disasters, went down with his ship in a
storm on his return homeward.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Ralegh obtained a new charter, March 25, 1584, drawn more carefully
with a design to foster colonization. Not only was he empowered to plant
colonies upon “such remote heathen and barbarous lands, not actually
possessed by any Christian prince nor inhabited by Christian people,” as
he might discover, but the soil of such lands was to be enjoyed by the
colonies forever, and the colonies planted were to “have all the privileges
of free denizens and persons native of England, in such ample manner as
if they were born and personally resident in our said realm of England, any
law, etc., notwithstanding,” and they were to be governed “according to
such statutes as shall be by him or them established; so that the said
statutes or laws conform as near as conveniently may be with those of
England, and do not oppugn the Christian faith, or any way withdraw the
people of those lands from our allegiance.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>These guarantees of political rights, which first appeared in the charter
to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, were renewed in the subsequent charter of 1606,
under which the English colonies were planted in America, and constituted
one of the impregnable grounds upon which they afterwards maintained the
struggle which ended in a complete separation from the mother country. It
is doubtless to Ralegh that we are indebted for these provisions, which justified
the Virginia burgesses in declaring in 1765,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That the first adventurers and settlers of this his Majesty’s colony and dominion
brought with them, and transmitted to their posterity and all other his Majesty’s subjects
since inhabiting in this his Majesty’s said colony, all the privileges, franchises,
and immunities that have at any time been held, enjoyed, and possessed by the people
of Great Britain.”</p>

<p class="p1">Ralegh’s knowledge of the voyages of the Spaniards satisfied him that
they had not explored the Atlantic coast north of what is now known as
Florida, and he determined to plant a colony in this unexplored region.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Two ships were immediately made ready, and they sailed April 27, 1584,
under the command of Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, for
the purpose of discovery, with a view to a permanent colony.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May they reached the Canaries, on the 10th of June
the West Indies, and on the 4th of July the American coast. They sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
northward one hundred and twenty miles before they found “any entrance
or river issuing into the sea.” They entered the first which they discovered,
probably that now known as New Inlet, and sailing a short distance into
the haven they cast anchor, and returned thanks to God for their safe
arrival. Manning their boats, they were soon on the nearest land, and
took possession of it in the name “of the Queen’s most excellent Majestie,
as rightful Queene and Princesse of the same,” and afterwards “delivered
the same over to Sir Walter Ralegh’s use, according to her Majestie’s
grant and letters patents under her Highnesse great seale.” They found
the land to be about twenty miles long and six miles wide, and, in the
language of the report to Sir Walter,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“very sandie and low towards the water’s side, but so ful of grapes, as the very
beating and surge of the sea overflowed them, of which we found such plentie, as
well there as in all places else, both on the sand and on the greene soile on the
hils as in the plaines, as well on every little shrubbe, as also climing towards the tops
of high cedars, that I thinke in all the world the like abundance is not to be found;
and myselfe having seene those parts of Europe that most abound, find such difference
as were incredible to be written.”</p>

<p class="p1">The report continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“This Island had many goodly Woodes full of Deere, Conies, Hares, and Fowle,
even in the middest of Summer, in incredible abondance. The Woodes are not such
as you finde in Bohemia, Moscovia, Hercynia, barren and fruitles, but the highest and
reddest Cedars of the world, farre bettering the Cedars of the Azores, of the Indies,
or Lybanus; Pynes, Cypres, Sassaphras, the Lentisk, or the tree that beareth the
Masticke, the tree that beareth the rind of blacke Sinamon.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the third day a boat with three natives approached the island, and
friendly intercourse was at once established. On the next there came
several boats, and in one of them Granganimeo, the king’s brother, “accompanied
with fortie or fiftie men, very handsome and goodly people, and in
their behavior as mannerly and civill as any of Europe.” When the
English asked the name of the country, one of the savages, who did not
understand the question, replied, “Win-gan-da-coa,” which meant, “You
wear fine clothes.” The English on their part, mistaking his meaning,
reported that to be the name of the country.</p>

<p>The King was named Wingina, and he was then suffering from a wound
received in battle. After two or three days Granganimeo brought his wife
and daughter and two or three children to the ships.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“His wife was very well favoured, of meane stature, and very bashfull; shee had on
her backe a long cloake of leather, with the furre side next to her body, and before
her a piece of the same; about her forehead shee hade a band of white corall, and so
had her husband many times; in her eares shee had bracelets of pearles hanging doune
to her middle, and these were of the bignes of good pease. The rest of her women
of the better sort had pendants of copper hanging in either eare; he himself had
upon his head a broad plate of golde or copper, for being unpolished we knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
what mettal it should be, neither would he by any meanes suffer us to take it off his
head, but feeling it, it would bow very easily. His apparell was as his wives, onely the
women wear their haire long on both sides, and the men but on one. They are of
colour yellowish, and their haire black for the most part, and yet we saw children that
had very fine auburne and chesnut-colored haire.”</p>

<p class="p1">The phenomenon of auburn and chestnut-colored hair may be accounted
for by the fact, related by the natives, that some years before a ship,
manned by whites, had been wrecked on the coast; and that some of the
people had been saved, and had lived with them for several weeks before
leaving in their boats, in which, however, they were lost. It was the descendants
of these men, doubtless, who were found by the English.</p>

<p>After the natives had visited the ships several times, Captain Barlowe
with seven men went in a boat twenty miles to an island called Roanoke
(probably a corruption of the Indian name Ohanoak), at the north end of
which “was a village of nine houses built of cedar and fortified round about
with sharp trees to keep out their enemies, and the entrance into it made
like a turnpike, very artificially.” There they found the wife of Granganimeo,
who, with her attendants, in the absence of her husband, entertained
them “with all loue and kindness, and with as much bounty (after their
manner) as they could possibly devise.”</p>

<p>They did not attempt to explore the mainland, but returned to England,
arriving about the middle of September, and carrying with them two of
the natives, Manteo and Manchese. They were enthusiastic concerning all
they had seen, describing the soil as “the most plentiful, sweet, fruitful,
and wholesome of all the world,” and “the people most gentle, loving, and
faithful, void of all guile and treason, and such as live after the manner of
the Golden Age.”</p>

<p>The Queen, not less delighted than Ralegh, named the newly-discovered
country <span class="smcap">Virginia</span>, in commemoration of her maiden life, and conferred
upon Ralegh the honor of knighthood. He now had a new seal of his
arms cut, with the legend, <i>Propria insignia Walteri Ralegh, militis, Domini
et Gubernatoris Virginiæ</i>. He was soon honored also with a seat in Parliament
by his native shire of Devon, and rose to eminence in that body.</p>

         alt=""

</div>

<p>Upon the return of his expedition Ralegh began to fit out a colony
to be planted in Virginia. Everything was made ready by the next
spring, and on the 9th of April, 1585, he sent from Plymouth a fleet of
seven ships in command of his cousin, Sir Richard Grenville, “with one
hundred householders, and many things necessary to begin a new state.”
The colony itself was put in the immediate
charge of Ralph Lane, who
was afterwards knighted by the King.
He had seen considerable service, and
was on duty in Ireland when invited
by Ralegh to take command of the colony. The Queen ordered a substitute
to be appointed in his government of Kerry and Clanmorris, “in consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of his ready undertaking the voyage to Virginia for Sir Walter
Ralegh at her Majesty’s command.” His residence in Ireland and Ralegh’s
interest there account for a number of Irish names which appear among the
colonists. Captain Philip Amadas was associated with Lane as his deputy,
and among those who accompanied him were two who were men of distinction.
One, Thomas Cavendish, afterwards became celebrated as a
navigator by sailing round the world; and another, Thomas Hariot, was
a mathematician of great distinction, who materially advanced the science
of algebra, and was honored by Descartes, who imposed some of Hariot’s
work upon the French as his own.</p>

<p>On the voyage the conduct of Sir Richard Grenville gave great offence
to Lane and the leading men of the colony, and Lane became convinced
that Grenville desired his death. On the 26th of June they came to anchor
at Wocokon, now known as Ocracoke Inlet. On the 11th of July Grenville
crossed the southern portion of Pamlico Sound, and discovered three Indian
towns,&mdash;Pomeiok, Aquascogoc, and Secotan. At Aquascogoc a silver
cup was stolen from one of his men, and failing to recover it, they “burned
and spoiled their corn, all the people being fled.” This act of harsh retribution
made enemies of the inhabitants of this part of the country, and was
unfortunate in its consequences.</p>

<p>Grenville landed the colony at Roanoke Island, and leaving Lane in
charge of one hundred and seven men, he sailed for England August 25,
promising to return with supplies by the next Easter. Lane at once erected
a fort on the island, and then began to explore the coast and rivers of the
country. The exploration southward extended about eighty miles, to the
present county of Carteret; northward, about one hundred and thirty miles,
to the vicinity of Elizabeth River; northwest, about the same distance, to
a point just below the junction of the Meherrin and Nottoway rivers; and
westward, up the Roanoke River to the vicinity of Halifax.</p>

<p>Lane was a man of decided ability and executive capacity. He informed
himself regarding the country and its inhabitants, and protected his men
from the many dangers which surrounded them. He soon became convinced
that a mistake had been made in attempting a settlement on Roanoke
Island, because of the dangerous coast and wretched harbor. He
learned on his voyage up the Chowan, from an Indian king named Monatonon,
that on going three days’ journey in a canoe up the river and four
days’ journey over land to the northeast, he would come to a king’s country
which lay upon the sea, whose place of greatest strength was an island
in a deep bay. This information evidently pointed to Craney Island in
Chesapeake Bay. Lane thereupon resolved, as soon as the promised supply
arrived from England, to send ships up the coast to discover the bay,
and to send men overland to establish posts, and if he found the bay to
be as described, to transfer the colony to its shore.</p>

<p>The two natives who had been carried to England had returned with Lane.
Manteo was a firm friend to the English, while Manchese became their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
implacable enemy. Granganimeo, the brother, and Ensenore, the father, of
Wingina, were also friendly, but both died within a few months after the arrival
of the colony, and the king, who had changed his name to Pemisapan,
did all in his power to destroy it. When Lane ascended the Roanoke, he
found that the tribes along its banks, with whom he had previously entered
into terms of friendship, had been informed by Pemisapan that the English
designed to kill them. They had retired into the interior with their families
and provisions, and Lane, whose supplies were running short, found great
difficulty in subsisting his men.</p>

<p>The exploration of this river, called by the Indians Moratoc, was deemed
of the greatest importance, as the natives reported it as flowing with a bold
stream out of a rock upon the coast of the Western Ocean, and running
through a land rich in minerals. During the voyage they were reduced to
great straits for subsistence, but the men insisted on going farther and feeding
on the flesh of dogs, rather than to give up the search. Finally they
were attacked by the natives, and being without food they returned from
their search for the mines and the South-Sea passage. The scarcity of
provisions at Roanoke Island had now become a matter of serious concern,
as the time had passed for Sir Richard Grenville to return with supplies,
and Pemisapan was endeavoring to starve them out. In order to get subsistence
Lane was forced to divide his men into three parties. One of these
he sent to the Island of Croatoan, and another to Hatorask. Learning from
Skyco, a son of King Monatonon, held as a hostage, that Pemisapan had
informed him of a plot to murder the English, Lane saved his men by striking
the first blow, and putting to death Pemisapan and seven or eight of
his chief men.</p>

<p>Within a few days afterwards Sir Francis Drake, with a fleet of twenty-three
sail, returning from sacking St. Domingo, Carthagina, and St. Augustine,
came in sight of the Island of Croatoan, and on the 10th of June came
to anchor near Roanoke Island. Drake acted in the most generous manner
towards the colonists. He proposed to carry them back to England
if they desired it, or to leave them sufficient shipping and provisions to
enable them to make further discovery. Lane and his men, being desirous
to stay, accepted the last offer, promising when they had searched the coast
for a better harbor to return to England in the coming August. They had
despaired of the return of Sir Richard Grenville, and they believed that
Ralegh had been prevented from looking after them by the condition of
public affairs in England. Sir Francis at once placed one of his ships at
the disposal of Lane, and began to put provisions aboard. Before this was
accomplished a storm arose, which lasted three days and threatened to destroy
the whole fleet. To save themselves several of the ships put to sea,
and among them the “Francis,” selected for the use of the colony, with
the provisions aboard. After the storm had abated Drake offered another
ship of much greater burden, it being the only one he could then spare; but
it being too heavy for the harbor and not suited for their purposes, Lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with the chief men determined to ask for a passage to England for the
colony, which was granted them by Drake, and they arrived at Plymouth
on the 27th of July, 1586, having lost but four of their number. Thomas
Hariot carried with him, on the return of the colony, a carefully prepared
description of the country,&mdash;its inhabitants, productions, animals, birds, and
fish,&mdash;and John White, the artist of the expedition, carried illustrations
in water-colors. Specimens of the productions of the country were also
carried by the colonists; and of these two, though not previously unknown
in Europe, through the exertions of Ralegh were brought into
general use, and have long been of the greatest importance. One was
the plant called by the natives <i>uppowoc</i>, but named by the Spaniards
tobacco; the other, the root known as the potato, which was introduced
into Ireland by being planted on the estate of Ralegh. In Hariot’s description
of the grain called by the Indians <i>pagatour</i>, we easily recognize
our Indian corn.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of the colony a ship arrived with supplies sent
by Ralegh, with a direction to assure them of further aid. Finding no one
on the island, this vessel returned to England. Fifteen days after its departure
Sir Richard Grenville arrived with three ships well provisioned,
but finding the island desolate, and searching in vain for the colony or
any information concerning it, he also returned, leaving, however, fifteen
men with provisions for two years. This was done to retain possession of
the country, and in ignorance of the hostility of the natives and of the
purpose of Lane to abandon that locality as a settlement. Though seemingly
wise and proper, it proved to be the source of further misfortune.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Ralegh, upon receiving the report of Lane, determined to
make no further effort to settle Roanoke Island, but at once began to
prepare for a settlement upon Chesapeake Bay. He granted a charter of
incorporation to thirty-two persons, nineteen of whom were merchants
of London who contributed their money, and thirteen, styled “the Governor
and Assistants of the city of Ralegh in Virginia,” who adventured
their persons in the enterprise. Of the nineteen styled merchants, ten
were afterwards subscribers to the Virginia Company of London which
settled Jamestown. Among them were Sir Thomas Smith, for years the
chief officer of that company, and one of the two Richard Hakluyts. John
White was selected as the governor, and with him were sent one hundred
and fifty persons, including seventeen women. They were carried in three
ships in charge of Simon Ferdinando, with directions to visit Roanoke
Island and take away the men left there by Sir Richard Grenville, and then
to steer for Chesapeake Bay. On July 22, 1587, they arrived at Hatorask,
and White, taking with him forty of his best men, started in the pinnace to
Roanoke Island.</p>

<p>Ferdinando, who was a Spaniard by birth, was either acting in the interest
of Spain or was angered by his difficulties with White. He had
purposely separated from one of the ships during the voyage, and instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of carrying the colony to Chesapeake Bay, as he had agreed, he no sooner
saw White and his men aboard the pinnace for Roanoke Island, than he
directed the sailors to bring none of the men back, on the pretext that the
summer was too far spent to be looking for another place. The colony
was thus forced to remain upon the island. They found evidence of the
massacre by the savages of the men left by Grenville, and they soon
experienced the hostility of the Indians toward themselves.</p>

<p>Manteo, who had gone to England with Lane, returned with White, and
was of the greatest service to the colony. By the direction of Ralegh he
“was christened in Roanoke, and called lord thereof, and of Dasamonguepeuk,
in reward of his faithful service.” On the 18th of August Eleanor,
daughter of the governor and wife of Ananias Dare one of the assistants,
gave birth to a daughter, “and because this child was the first Christian
born in Virginia, she was named Virginia.”</p>

<p>The little vessel, from which Ferdinando had parted company, arrived
safely with the rest of the colony aboard in a few days, and the men who
landed on the island, all told, were one hundred and twenty souls.</p>

<p>When the time came for the ships to return to England it was determined
by the unanimous voice of the colony to send White back to represent
their condition and to obtain relief. He at first refused to go, but at
last yielded to their solicitation, and on the 5th of November arrived in
England.</p>

<p>When White landed he found the kingdom alarmed by the threatened
Spanish invasion. Ralegh, Grenville, and Lane were all members of the
council of war, and were bending every energy toward the protection of
England from the Spanish Armada. Ralegh’s genius shone forth conspicuously
in this crisis, and his policy of defending England on the water
by a well-equipped fleet was not only adopted, but has been steadily
pursued since, and has resulted in her becoming the great naval power
of the world.</p>

<p>Ralegh did not forget his colony, however, and by the spring he had
fitted out for its relief a small fleet, which he placed under the command
of Sir Richard Grenville. Before it sailed every ship was impressed by the
Government, and Sir Richard was required to attend Sir Walter, who was
training troops in Cornwall. Governor White, with Ralegh’s aid, succeeded
in sailing for Virginia with two vessels, April 22, 1588, but encountering
some Spanish ships and being worsted in a sea-fight, he was forced to return
to England, and the voyage was abandoned for the time. White was
not able to renew his effort to relieve the colony during the year 1589, but
during the next year, finding that three ships ready to sail for the West
Indies at the charges of John Wattes, a London merchant, had been detained
by the order prohibiting any vessel from leaving England, he applied
to Ralegh to obtain permission for them to sail, on condition that they
should take him and some others with supplies to Roanoke Island. After
obtaining permission to sail on this condition, the owner and commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the ships refused to take any one aboard except White; and as they
were in the act of sailing, and White had no time to lodge complaint against
them, he went aboard, determined alone to prosecute his search. On the
15th of August they came to anchor at Hatorask. When White left the
colony they had determined to remove fifty miles into the interior, and it
had been agreed that they should carve on the trees or posts of the doors
the name of the place where they were seated, and if they were in distress
a cross was to be carved above the name. White found no one on the
island, but the houses he had left had been taken down and a fort erected,
which had been so long deserted that grass was growing in it. The bark
had been cut from one of the largest trees near the entrance, and five
feet from the ground, in fair capital letters, was cut the word <span class="smcap">Croatoan</span>,
without any sign of distress. Further search developed the fact that five
chests, buried near the fort, had been dug up and their contents destroyed.
White recognized among the fragments of the articles some of his own
books, maps, and pictures. He concluded that the colony had removed
to Croatoan, the island from which Manteo came, whose inhabitants had
been friendly to the English. White at once begged the captain of the
ship to carry him to Croatoan, which the captain promised to do; but
a violent storm preventing, he finally determined to sail for England,
where they arrived on the 24th of October. This was White’s fifth and
last voyage, as he states in his letter to Hakluyt in 1593. His disappointment
produced despondency, and he abandoned all hope of relieving the
colony, with whom he had left his daughter and grandchild.</p>

<p>Ralegh had already spent forty thousand pounds in his several efforts
to colonize Virginia, and he found himself unable to follow up his design
from his own purse alone. He thereupon leased his patent to a company
of merchants, hoping thus to achieve his object. But in this he
was disappointed. He did not abandon all hope of final success, however,
but continued to send out ships to look for his lost colony. In
1602 he made his fifth effort to afford them help by sending Captain Samuel
Mace, a mariner of experience, with instructions to search for them.
Mace returned without executing his orders, and Ralegh wrote to Sir
Robert Cecil on the 21st August that he would send Mace back, and expressed
his faith in the colonization of Virginia in these words, “I shall
yet live to see it an Englishe nation.” He lived, indeed, to see his prediction
verified, but not until he was immured in the Tower of London.
During the last years of Elizabeth’s reign he continually pressed the Secretary
and Privy Council for facilities to resume his schemes, but without
success; and he finally abandoned all hope of finding the colony left at
Roanoke Island.</p>

<p>What became of this colony was long a question of anxious inquiry,
only to be solved by the information obtained from the Indians after the
English settled at Jamestown. It was then ascertained that they had intermixed
with the natives, and, after living with them till about the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
arrival of the colony at Jamestown, had been cruelly massacred at the instigation
of Powhatan, acting under the persuasions of his priests.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Only
seven of them&mdash;four men, two boys, and a young maid&mdash;had been preserved
from slaughter by a friendly chief. From these was descended a
tribe of Indians found in the vicinity of Roanoke Island in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and known as the Hatteras Indians. They had
gray eyes, which were found among no other tribes, and claimed to have
white people as their ancestors.</p>

<p>The failure of Ralegh’s efforts to colonize Virginia may be ascribed to
the inherent difficulties of the enterprise, increased by the inexperience
of those sent out; to the unfortunate selection of the place of settlement;
and, above all, to the war with Spain, which prevented Ralegh from taking
proper care of the infant colony until it could become self-sustaining.</p>

<p>But although the colonies he sent to Virginia perished, to Ralegh must
be awarded the honor of securing the possession of North America to the
English. It was through his enterprise that the advantages of its soil and
climate were made known in England, and that the Chesapeake Bay was
fixed upon as the proper place of settlement; and it was his genius that
created the spirit of colonization which led to the successful settlement
upon that bay.</p>

<p>Ralegh incurred the displeasure of the Queen in 1592 by his marriage
with Elizabeth Throgmorton, her beautiful maid of honor. He was more
than compensated, however, by the acquisition of a faithful and loving wife,
who was in every way worthy of him. The jealous Queen sent them both
to the Tower. After a few months’ imprisonment Sir Walter was released,
that he might superintend the division of the rich spoil taken in the Spanish
ship “Madre de Dios,” on her return from the West Indies, by a privateering
fleet which he had sent out. The Queen was personally interested in
this enterprise, and got the lion’s share of the profits. Afterward he was
permitted to retire with his wife to his estate, and there he matured his
plans for a voyage to Guiana, which he had been long considering. His
colony had found no mines in Virginia, and he longed to make England
the rival of Spain in mineral wealth.</p>

<p>Spanish travellers had reported that the natives told of a city of gold
called “El Dorado,” which was situated in the unexplored region of the
northeastern portion of South America, known as the “Empire of Guiana.”
Between the years 1530 and 1560 a number of expeditions had been sent
by the Spaniards to this unknown land. They had proved unsuccessful,
and been attended with great loss of life and money. Ralegh was seized
with a desire to visit this region and secure its riches. In 1594 he sent out
Jacob Whiddon, with instructions to examine the coast contiguous to the
River Orinoco, and to explore that river and its tributaries. Whiddon met
at the Island of Trinidad with Antonio de Berreo, the Spanish governor,
who was himself planning an exploration of the region along the Orinoco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and who opposed every obstacle to the success of Whiddon’s mission.
Ralegh’s agent returned to England towards the close of the year with but
little trustworthy information. Sir Walter continued his preparations, however,
and on February 9, 1595, with a squadron of five ships, he sailed from
Plymouth for Trinidad, having aboard one hundred officers, soldiers, and
gentlemen adventurers. Before the end of March he arrived at Trinidad.
He captured the town of St. Joseph, and took Berreo prisoner. Treating
his captive with kindness, Ralegh soon learned from him what he knew of
Guiana. He was informed by Berreo that the empire of Guiana had more
gold than Peru; that the imperial city called by the Spaniards “El Dorado”
was called by the Indians “Manoa,” and was situated on a lake of salt water
two hundred leagues long, and that it was the largest and richest city in the
world. Berreo showed Sir Walter a copy of a narrative by Juan Martinez
of his journey to Manoa, which had induced Berreo to send a special messenger
to Spain to get up an expedition for the conquest of El Dorado, or,
as it was then called, “Laguna de la Gran Manoa.”</p>

<p>This narrative appeared to confirm the marvellous tales concerning El
Dorado which had so long obtained credence. Ralegh did not rely on
Berreo, however, but sought out the oldest among the Indians on the
island, and inquired of them concerning the country, its streams and inhabitants.
He then started upon his perilous voyage up the Orinoco, with
four boats and provisions for a month. He entered by the most northern
of the divisions through which that remarkable river flows into the sea,
and after struggling against its rapid, various, and dangerous currents for
more than a month, and reaching the mouth of the Caroni, and ascending
that stream some forty miles to the vicinity of its falls, he was forced by
the rising of the river to return,&mdash;finding that his farther progress was
not only prevented thereby, but his return made dangerous. He supposed
he had gone four hundred miles by the windings of the river, and he was
still more than two hundred miles from the country of which Manoa was
the capital, according to the reckoning of Berreo. Ralegh did not find
the rich deposits of gold he had hoped for, but saw, as he supposed,
many indications of that metal, and secured specimens of ores and
precious stones. He found that the Spaniards had previously traversed
the country contiguous to the river, and been cruel in their treatment of
the natives. He informed them that his Queen, whose portrait he showed
them, was the enemy of the Spaniards, and that he came to deliver them
from their tyranny. He soon made them his fast friends by his kindness,
and an old chief, Topiawari, promised to unite the several tribes along the
river in a league against the Spaniards by the time Sir Walter should return.
This chief gave his son to Ralegh as a pledge of his fidelity, and received
in return two Englishmen, who were instructed to learn what they could of
the country, and, if possible, to go to the city of Manoa.</p>

<p>Ralegh arrived in England in the latter part of the summer of 1595,
after laying under contribution several Spanish settlements on the way. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
published a glowing account of his voyage, in which he related not only
the wonderful things he had seen, but the more wonderful things which had
been told him by the Spaniards and natives. He was firmly persuaded of
the existence of El Dorado, and also that there lived in Guiana the Amazons,
a race of women who allowed no man to remain among them; and
the Ewaipanoma, a tribe who had their eyes in their shoulders and their
mouths in the middle of their breasts. The publication was eagerly read,
and increased his already great reputation. But it was severely criticised
at the time, as it has been since by Hume and other historians. During
the present century two distinguished men&mdash;Humboldt and Schomburgk&mdash;have
explored the Orinoco and the countries drained by it and its
almost innumerable tributaries. They found that what Ralegh stated of
the country, as coming under his own observation, was true, while many
of the tales told him by others were the merest fiction.</p>

<p>In January, 1596, Ralegh sent Captain Laurence Keymis, a companion of
his first voyage, with two ships, to renew the exploration of the Orinoco,
with a view to planting a colony. He returned in June, and his report
confirmed Ralegh in his belief in the mineral wealth of the country. He
brought intelligence, however, of a Spanish settlement made by Berreo
near the mouth of the Caroni, with the men sent out to him from Spain.</p>

<p>When Keymis landed in England he found that Ralegh had been partially
restored to the favor of the Queen, and united with Essex and Howard
in command of the force sent to attack Cadiz. The operations before that
city were directed by Ralegh’s genius, and he led the van of the naval
attack which resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet and the capture
of the city. From the effects of this blow Spain never recovered, and
the 21st of June, 1596, the day of the battle, marks the date of her decline
as one of the great powers. During the next year he struck her another
blow by the capture of Fayal.</p>

<p>In the year 1596 Ralegh despatched one of the smaller ships which had
fought at Cadiz, to Guiana, under the command of Captain Leonard Berry,
but with no important results. In 1598 he attempted to get together a
fleet of thirteen ships, to be commanded by Sir John Gilbert, with which
to convey a colony to the fertile valley of the Orinoco, but from some cause,
not known, he failed.</p>

<p>His frequent failures did not dampen his ardor in the cause of colonization,
but he found that it “required a prince’s purse to have it thoroughly
followed out,” and he therefore endeavored to interest the Ministry in his
schemes. But the end of the great Queen was approaching, and instead
of aiming at the enlargement of her kingdom, her ministers were scheming
for their own advancement with her successor.</p>

<p>The accession of James to the throne of England changed the fortunes
of Ralegh. When he met the King he found the royal mind already
prejudiced against him. He was displaced from the Captaincy of
the Guard, and shortly afterwards was arrested on a charge of treason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in plotting with the Count of Arenburg, an ambassador of the Archduke
Albert, to place Lady Arabella Stuart upon the throne, and to obtain aid
from the King of Spain for the purpose. The mockery of a trial which
followed drew from one of his judges the statement, which succeeding ages
have pronounced true, that “never before was English justice so injured
or so degraded.” The brutal conduct of Sir Edward Coke who prosecuted,
and of Chief-Justice Popham who presided, at the trial, and denied
the request of Ralegh to be confronted with the witnesses against him, has
consigned their memory to lasting infamy. That Ralegh, after spending his
life in war with Spain, should plot with her to overthrow his King and put
another in his place is not credible, and that the Government that prosecuted
him did not believe the charge is conclusively shown by the fact,
that the Count of Arenburg retained the favor of King James, and further,
that some of the men prominent in the prosecution were at the time in the
paid service of Spain.</p>

<p>James did not proceed to execute the sentence of death which his corrupt
court had pronounced against Ralegh, but kept him a prisoner in the Tower
for thirteen years. In prison he devoted himself to the study of chemistry
and to literary composition; and the great wrong done in depriving him
of his liberty resulted in that literary treasure, the <i>History of the World</i>.</p>

<p>As prison life became more and more irksome to Ralegh, he attempted
to relieve himself from it by obtaining employment in Virginia or Guiana,
promising the King rich returns if he would but permit him to visit either
country. Finally, by bribing those who had the ear of the King, he was
released January 30, 1616, to prepare for a voyage to Guiana. He had
been assured by Keymis that a rich mine existed near the mouth of the
Caroni, and he pledged himself to find it or else to bear all the expenses
of the expedition. Keymis was to go along with him, and also a sufficient
force “to defend him against the Spaniards inhabiting upon the Orenocke,
if they offered to assaile him,&mdash;not that it is meant to offend the Spaniards
there, or to beginne any quarrell with them, except themselves shall beginne
the warre.” It was said in London at the time that Ralegh wanted to
obtain a pardon under the Great Seal, but it required a further expenditure
of money which he needed in his expedition, and he was advised by Bacon
that the King’s commission under which he sailed was equivalent to a
pardon. The release of Ralegh enabled him to see Pocahontas, who was
in England in 1616, and we can well conceive with what interest he beheld
her who had so much aided in realizing his hope of seeing Virginia an
English nation.</p>

<p>King James had fallen under the influence of Count Gondomar, the Spanish
ambassador, to whom Ralegh was particularly obnoxious on account of
his lifelong enmity to Spain. The Count attempted to prevent the sailing
of the expedition, but failing in that, he obtained from the King Ralegh’s
plans, and at once transmitted them to Madrid, where steps were immediately
taken to thwart them. In June, 1617, Ralegh sailed with eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
vessels from Plymouth, having with him his son, young Walter Ralegh,
Captain Keymis, and four hundred and thirty-one men. He arrived at
Trinidad in December, suffering from the effects of a violent fever. He
was too feeble to attempt the ascent of the Orinoco, but sent forward his
son and Keymis. When they approached St. Thomas, settled since his
first voyage, they were attacked by the Spaniards. The conflict ended in
the taking of the town, but at the cost of young Walter Ralegh’s life.
Keymis continued the search for the mine, and with a part of his men
reached the vicinity of the place at which he had located it on his previous
voyage. The hostility of the Spaniards reduced his numbers so that he
felt forced to return to St. Thomas for reinforcements. After returning
to that point he became despondent, and finally burnt the town and returned
to Trinidad, taking along with him documents found at St. Thomas,
which showed that the plans of Ralegh, communicated to the King, had
been betrayed to the Court of Madrid. When Keymis met Ralegh and
saw how he was affected by the failure of the expedition and the loss of
his son, and heard his reproaches, he was seized with remorse at the
thought that upon him rested the responsibility for the failure, and committed
suicide.</p>

<p>Ralegh, utterly dispirited and broken-hearted, now turned his face homeward,
and arrived at Plymouth early in July, 1618. He was arrested upon
his arrival, by order of the King, on the charge of breaking the peace with
Spain. No trial was had upon this charge, which could not have been sustained;
but as the King of Spain demanded that he should be put to death
James sought for a legal cover for compliance, and upon the advice of Bacon
determined to issue a warrant for his execution upon the conviction of 1603.
Ralegh was brought before the Court of King’s Bench on the 28th of
October, and asked what he had to allege in further stay of execution. He
pleaded his commission from the King, giving him command of the expedition
to Guiana, as working a pardon, but was told that “Treason must be
pardoned by express words, not by implication.” Nothing remained but
to execute the death-warrant, already drawn by Bacon and signed by the
King. He was beheaded on the next day, meeting death with the greatest
fortitude. His execution excited the horror and indignation of the Protestant
world, and King James was at once arraigned at the bar of public
opinion. He called to his defence the genius of his Lord Chancellor, and
Bacon attempted to justify him by publishing a disgraceful attack upon
Ralegh’s fame. But the effort was in vain. The world acquitted Ralegh
of the charges which had been made the pretext of his judicial murder,
and adjudged King James to be the real criminal.</p>

<h3><a name="c121" id="c121">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE life of Sir Walter Ralegh, reprehensible in some of its parts, but admirable
in most and brilliant in all, has been variously portrayed. Lord Bacon in 1618
published in quarto <i>A Declaration of the Demeanor and Carrige of Sir Walter Ralegh,
as well in his Voyage as in and since his Return</i>, etc., intending it as a justification
of the conduct of King James in beheading him;
but it grossly misrepresented him. He began with the
statement that “Kings are not bound to give account
of their actions to any but God alone;” but the whole
apology is framed upon the theory that King James was
forced by the popular voice to give an account of this base action. It appears from a
letter of Bacon to the Marquis of Buckingham, dated Nov. 22, 1618,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> that the King made
very material additions to the manuscript after Bacon had prepared it.</p>

</div>

<p>The first Life of Ralegh was published with his works not long after his death. The
name of the author is not given, and it is not a full narrative, but was written during his
life or soon after his death.</p>

<p>The next publication was under the style of <i>The Life of the Valiant and Learned Sir
Walter Ralegh, Knight, with his Tryal at Winchester</i>, London: printed by J. D. for Benj.
Shirley and Richard Tonsin, 1677. This has sometimes been attributed to James Shirley,
the dramatist, who was a contemporary of Ralegh. The narrative, however, was little more
than what was already known from books familiar to the public.</p>

<p>In 1701 the Rev. John Prince, a fellow-Devonian, published in his <i>Worthies of Devon</i>
a short memoir of Ralegh, which was the best account of its subject that had then
appeared. He was able to throw light upon some of the obscurer portions of his life by
his local knowledge, and his book is still worthy of perusal.</p>

<p>No other Life of Ralegh of value appeared until 1733, when William Oldys published
his work, which showed great industry in collecting and judgment in arranging his material.
For near a century it was the standard <i>Life of Ralegh</i>, and was the source from
which writers derived their materials. Notwithstanding the criticism of Gibbon, that “it
is a servile panegyric or flat apology,” this work is of great value. It contains all that was
accessible, when it was published, from printed records, and much information derived from
the descendants of Ralegh and from his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Birch published three several Lives of Ralegh,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>&mdash;the first in 1734, in the
<i>General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</i>. This author corresponded with the descendants
of Ralegh, and collected various anecdotes of him, but he made no additions of real
value to the work of Oldys.</p>

<p>The next work worthy of mention was by Arthur Cayley in 1805, although a dozen
Lives perhaps appeared between Birch’s and this. Cayley made valuable additions to the
knowledge concerning Ralegh which Oldys had gathered. He brought to light several
new and valuable documents, which threw additional light upon his subject.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>In 1830 Mrs. A. T. Thompson published a <i>Life of Ralegh</i> in London, which was
republished in Philadelphia in 1846, containing fifteen original letters then first printed
from the collection in the State-Paper Office, throwing light on the share he took in the
political transactions of his times. It was of but little additional value so far as its other
materials were concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1833 Patrick Fraser Tytler published a <i>Life of Ralegh</i>, “with a Vindication of his
Character from the Attacks of Hume<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and other writers.” This writer added several
original documents to the material previously used, but his publication is more justly
entitled to the criticism of Gibbon on the work of Oldys than was that book. He first
carefully traced out the conspiracy which brought Ralegh to the scaffold.</p>

<p>In 1837 there appeared in Lardner’s <i>Cabinet of Biography</i>, among the Lives of the
British Admirals, an excellent life of Ralegh by Robert Southey, the poet. The author’s
only addition to the knowledge afforded by previous writers was in reference to the Guiana
expeditions, the additional information being drawn from Spanish sources.</p>

<p>In 1847 the Hakluyt Society published Ralegh’s accounts of his voyages to Guiana,
with notes and a biographical memoir by Sir Robert H. Schomburgk. This memoir is an
admirable summary of what was then known of Ralegh, and the publication is a complete
vindication of Ralegh’s statements and conduct in reference to Guiana. The notes of
the author are of the greatest value. He was a British Commissioner to survey the
boundaries of Guiana in 1841, and traversed the country visited by Ralegh and those
sent out by him. He also had the benefit of Humboldt’s previous exploration of the
country. This writer published for the first time two valuable manuscripts in the British
Museum, both from the pen of Ralegh. One was written about the year 1596, and
entitled “Of the Voyage for Guiana,” and the other was the journal of his last voyage to
that country.</p>

<p>In 1868 there was published in London the most valuable of all the biographies of
Ralegh. It was written by Edward Edwards, and is “based on contemporary documents
preserved in the Rolls House, the Privy Council Office, Hatfield House, the British
Museum, and other manuscript repositories, British and foreign, together with his letters
now first collected.” The author also had the advantage of the correspondence of the
French ambassador at London during the latter part of Ralegh’s life. He has cleared up
some of the obscure parts of Ralegh’s career, and has, not only by the very full collection
of his letters, but by the admirable treatment of his subject, rendered invaluable service
to his memory.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Another Life of Ralegh, published in the same year (1868) by St. John, is also the
embodiment of the latest information, and is better adapted to the general reader than
that of Edwards, and elucidates some points more fully.</p>

<p>The voyage of Amadas and Barlow to Roanoke Island in 1584 was related by the latter in
a Report addressed to Sir Walter Ralegh. The voyage of Sir Richard Grenville in 1585, conveying
Ralph Lane and the colony under his command, was related by one of the persons
who accompanied Grenville, and the account of what happened after their arrival was written
by one of the colonists, probably Lane himself.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> An account of the country, its inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and productions, was written by Thomas Hariot (<i>b.</i> 1560; <i>d.</i> 1621), one of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
There are also accounts of the voyages of John White to Virginia written by himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>These several publications are found together in Hakluyt, and are of the highest
authority. They have been republished by Francis L. Hawks, D.D., LL.D., with valuable
notes, in the first volume of his <i>History of North Carolina</i>, published in 1857. Dr.
Hawks was a native of North Carolina, and personally familiar with its coast, and thus
enabled to fix the localities mentioned in the early voyages. His book is accompanied
with valuable maps. He defends Lane with much ability from the attacks of Bancroft
and others.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The letters of Ralph Lane constitute a very valuable addition to the history of Lane’s
colony, and show that the disputes between Lane and Grenville had in all probability
much to do with Lane’s abandonment of the enterprise.</p>

voyage is given by Schomburgk from the original manuscript in the British Museum.
The collections of the works of Ralegh show his several other writings concerning Guiana,
among which are an “Apology for the Voyage to Guiana,” written in 1618, on his way from
Plymouth to London as a prisoner; to gain time for the preparation of which he feigned
sickness at Salisbury. Expecting to be put to death, he was determined before he died
fully and elaborately to justify to the world his last expedition, which had been grossly
misrepresented. It was not published till 1650.</p>

<p>In Force’s <i>Historical Tracts</i>, vol. iii., there is published a letter, written Nov. 17, 1617,
“from the River Aliana, on the coast of Guiana,” by a gentleman of the fleet, who signs
his initials “R. M.” It is entitled <i>Newes of Sir Walter Rawleigh</i>, and gives the
orders he issued to the commanders of his fleet, and some account of the incidents of the
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>In Sir Walter Ralegh’s <i>History of the World</i> he often illustrates his subject by the
incidents of his own life, and thus we have in the book much of an autobiography.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">ON the petition of Hakluyt (then prebendary of Westminster), Sir
Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, and other “firm and hearty
lovers of colonization,” James I., by patent dated
the 10th of April, 1606, chartered two companies
(the London and the Plymouth), and bestowed on
them in equal proportions the vast territory (then
known as Virginia) lying between the thirty-fourth
and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude, together
with the islands within one hundred miles of the coast stretching from
Cape Fear to Halifax.</p>

<p>The code of laws provided for the government of the proposed colonies
was complicated, inexpedient, and characteristic of the mind of the first
Stuart. For each colony separate councils appointed by the King were
instituted in England, and these were in turn to name resident councillors in
the colonies, with power to choose their own president and to fill vacancies.
Capital offences were to be tried by a jury, but all other cases were left to the
decision of the council. This body was, however, to govern itself according
to the prescribed mandates of the King. The religion of the Church of
England was established, and the oath of obedience was a prerequisite to
residence in the colony. Lands were to descend as at common law, and a
community of labor and property was to continue for five years. The Adventurers,
as the members of the Company were termed, were authorized to
mine for gold, silver, and copper, to coin money, and to collect a revenue for
twenty-one years from all vessels trading to their ports. Certain articles of
necessity, imported for the use of the colonists, were exempted from duty
for seven years. Sir Thomas Smith, an eminent merchant of London, who
had been the chief of the assignees of Sir Walter Raleigh and ambassador
to Russia, was appointed treasurer of the Company.</p>

<p>But the body of the men who composed the expedition had little care
for forms of government. A wilder chimera than the impractical devices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the selfish and pedantic monarch possessed them. “I tell thee,” says Seagull,
in the play of <i>Eastward Ho!</i> which was popular for years, “golde is
more plentifull there than copper is with us; and for as much redde copper
as I can bring I’ll have thrise the weight in gold. Why, man, all their
dripping-pans ... are pure gould; and all the chaines with which they
chaine up their streets are massie gold; and for rubies and diamonds, they
goe forth in Holydayes and gather ‘hem by the seashore, to hang on their
children’s coates and sticke in their children’s caps, as commonly as our
children weare saffron gilt brooches and groates with holes in ‘hem.” A
life of ease and luxury is pictured by Seagull, and, as the climax of allurement,
with “no more law than conscience, and not too much of eyther.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
The expedition left Blackwall on the 19th of December, but was detained
by “unprosperous winds” in the Downs until the 1st of January, 1606-7.
It consisted of three vessels,&mdash;the “Susan Constant,” of one hundred tons,
with seventy-one persons, in charge of the experienced navigator Captain
Christopher Newport (the commander of the fleet); the “God-Speed,” of
forty tons, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, carrying fifty-two persons; and
the “Discovery,” of twenty tons, Captain John Ratcliffe, carrying twenty
persons. The crews of the ships must have constituted thirty-nine of the
total of these, as the number of the first planters was one hundred and
five. In the lists of their names, more than half are classed as “gentlemen,”
and the remainder as laborers, tradesmen, and mechanics. Two
“chirurgeons,” Thomas Wotton, or Wootton, and Wil. Wilkinson, are included;
the service of the first of them in a professional capacity is afterwards
noted. Sailing by the old route of the West Indies, the Virginia
coast was reached on the 26th of April, and in Chesapeake Bay on that
night the instructions from the King were examined. These, with a mystery
well calculated to promote mischief, had been confided to Newport, in
a sealed box, with the injunction that it should not be opened until he
reached his destination. The councillors found to be designated were
Edward Maria Wingfield, Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Christopher
Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Martin, and John Kendall. Wingfield, a man
of honorable birth and a strict disciplinarian, who had been a companion
of Ferdinando Gorges in the European wars, was chosen president; and
Thomas Studley, cape-merchant, or treasurer.</p>

<p>On the 29th of the month a cross was planted at Cape Henry, which was
so named in honor of the Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James;
the name of his second son, then Duke of York, afterwards Charles I., being
perpetuated in the opposite cape. The point at which the ships anchored
the next day was designated, in thankful spirit, Point Comfort. On the 13th
of May, 1607, the colonists landed at a peninsula on the northern bank of
the river known to the natives as Powhatan, after their king, but to which
the English gave the name James River. Upon this spot, about fifty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
from its mouth, they resolved to build their first town, to which they also
gave the name of the English monarch. The selection of this site is said
to have been urged by Smith and objected to by Gosnold. The better judgment
of the latter was vindicated in the sequel. Smith&mdash;at this time not
yet twenty-eight years of age, a man the most remarkably endowed among
those nominated for the council, and whose administrative capacity was to
be so prominently evidenced&mdash;was at first excluded from his seat because,
says Purchas, he had been “suspected of a supposed mutinie” on the voyage
over.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> This proscription in all probability had no more warrant than
in the jealousy which the recent adventurous career and the confident
bearing of Smith may be supposed to have excited, since he was admitted
to office on the 10th of June following. The colonists at once set about
building fortifications and establishing the settlement. Newport, Smith,
and twenty-three others in the mean time ascended the river in a shallop
on a tour of exploration. At an Indian village below the falls was found a
lad of about ten years of age with yellow hair and whitish skin, who, it has
been assumed, was the offspring of some representative of the ill-fated
Roanoke Colony left by White, of which it is narrated that seven persons
were preserved from slaughter by an Indian chief.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> On the 26th of May,
the day before the return of the explorers to Jamestown, the unfinished fort
(not completed until the 15th of June) was attacked by the savages, who
were repulsed by the colonists under the command of Wingfield. The colonists
had one boy killed and eleven men wounded, one of whom died.
Communion was administered by the chaplain, the Rev. Robert Hunt, on
Sunday, the 21st of June, and on the next day Newport sailed for England
in the “Susan Constant,” laden with specimens of the forest and with mineral
productions. A bark or pinnace, with provisions sufficient to sustain
the colonists for three months, was left with them. The prospect of the
men thus cast upon their own resources, was not promising. Disturbed by
the fatuous hope of discovering gold, divided by faction, unused to the
labor and hardships to which they were now subjected, and in daily peril
from the hostility of the savages, the difficulties of success were enhanced by
the insalubrity of their ill-chosen settlement. By September fifty of them,
including the intrepid Gosnold, had died, and the store of damaged provisions
upon which they mainly depended was nearly exhausted. Violent
dissension ensued, which resulted, on the 10th of the month, in the displacement
of Wingfield by Ratcliffe in the office of president, and the deposing,
imprisonment, and finally the execution of Kendall; by which the Council,
never more than seven in number (including Newport), and in which no
vacancies had been filled, was reduced to three only,&mdash;Ratcliffe, Smith, and
Martin. Reprehensible as the conduct of the colonists at this period may
have been, they yet held religious observances in regard. Their piety and
reverence are instanced both by Smith and Wingfield. In Bagnall’s narrative
in the <i>Historie</i> of the first, it is noted that “order was daily to haue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Prayer, with a Psalme;”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and Wingfield states that when their store of
liquors was reduced to two gallons each of “sack” and “aqua-vitæ,” the
first was “reserued for the communion table.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>Differences among the colonists being somewhat allayed, labor was
resumed, habitations were provided, a church was built, and, through the
courage and energy of Smith, supplies of corn were obtained from the Indians.
Leaving the settlement on the 10th of December, Smith again ascended
the Chickahominy to get provisions from the savages, but incurring
their hostility, two of his companions, Emry and Robinson, were killed, and
Smith himself was taken captive. Being released after a few weeks, on the
promise of a ransom of “two great guns and a grindstone,” he returned to
Jamestown. On his arrival there he found the number of the colonists reduced
to forty, and that Captain Gabriel Archer had been admitted to the
Council during his absence. Archer caused him to be arrested and indicted,
under the Levitical law, for allowing the death of his two men; but in the
evening of the same day, Jan. 8, 1607-8, Newport returned from England
with additional settlers (a portion of the first supply), and at once released
both Smith and Wingfield from custody. Within five or six days the fort
and many of the houses at Jamestown were destroyed by an accidental fire.
Newport, accompanied by Matthew Scrivener (newly arrived and admitted
to the Council), with Smith as interpreter and thirty or forty others, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
visited Powhatan at his abode of Werowocomico. This was at Timberneck
Bay, on the north side of York River. On the east bank of the bay
still stands a quaint stone chimney,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> subsequently built for Powhatan by
German workmen among the colonists. Hostages were exchanged;
Namontack, an Indian who was taken to England by Newport, being
received from Powhatan for Thomas Savage, a youth aged thirteen, who
for many years afterwards rendered important service to the colonists as
interpreter. With supplies of food obtained from Powhatan and Opecancanough,
the chief of the Pamunkey tribe, the party returned to Jamestown.</p>

<p>The ship being loaded with iron ore, sassafras, cedar posts, and walnut
boards, Newport, with Archer<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and Wingfield as passengers, sailed on the
10th of April from Jamestown, and on the 20th of May, 1608, arrived in
England. The diet of the colonists was soon reduced to meal and water,
and through hunger and exposure death diminished them one half. While
they were engaged in re-building Jamestown and in planting, to their great
joy Captain Nelson, who had left England with Newport, but from whom he
had been separated by storm and detained in the West Indies, arrived in the
ship “Phœnix,” with provisions and seventy settlers, being the remainder of
the first supply of one hundred and twenty. He departed for England on
the 2d of June with a cargo of cedar-wood, carrying Martin of the Council.
Smith, in an open boat, with fourteen others,&mdash;seven gentlemen (including
Dr. Walter Russell of the last arrival), and seven soldiers,&mdash;accompanied
the “Phœnix” down the river, and parted from her at Cape Henry, with the
bold purpose of exploring Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, and establishing
intercourse with the natives along their borders. To the islands lying off
Cape Charles, Smith gave his own name. After a satisfactory cruise, having
crossed the bay, visited its eastern shore, and explored the Potomac River
some thirty miles, the party returned late in July to Jamestown for provisions.
Smith again embarked on the 24th of July to complete his explorations,
with a crew of twelve, similarly constituted as before, but with
Anthony Bagnall as surgeon. At the head of Chesapeake Bay they were
hospitably entertained by a tribe of Indians, supposed by Stith<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> to have
been of the Iroquois, or Five Nations, and also by the Susquehannas, at a
village on the Tockwogh (now Sassafras) River. The highest mountain to
the northward observed by them was named Peregrine’s Mount, and Willoughby
River was so called after the native town of Smith. The Indian tribes
on the Patuxent, and the Moraughtacunds and the Wighcomoes on the Rappahannock,
were visited. Richard Featherstone, a “gentleman” of the party,
dying, was buried on the banks of the last-named river, which was explored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to the falls, near where Fredericksburg now is. Here a skirmish took place
with the Rappahannock tribe. The Pianketank, Elizabeth, and Nansemond
rivers were in turn examined for a few miles. From the results of these
discoveries Smith composed his Map of Virginia, a work so singularly exact
that it has formed the basis of all like delineations since, and was adduced as
authority as late as 1873 towards the settlement of the boundary dispute
between the States of Virginia and Maryland. The drawing was sent to
England by Newport before the close of the year, and in 1612 was published
in the <i>Oxford Tract</i>. Returning to Jamestown, Sept. 7, 1608, Smith was
elected President of the Council over Ratcliffe (who suffered from a wounded
hand and was enfeebled by sickness), and now, for the first time, he had the
“letters patent” of office placed in his hands.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Ever firm, courageous, and
persevering, he at once instituted vigorous and salutary measures adapted
to the wants and conducive to the discipline of the colonists. The church
was repaired, the storehouse covered, and magazines erected. Soon after,
Newport arrived for the third time from England, with the second supply
of settlers, seventy in number. Among them were Captains Peter Wynne
and Richard Waldo, Francis West (the brother of Lord Delaware), Raleigh
Crashaw, Daniel Tucker, some German and Polish artisans for the
manufacture of glass and other articles, Mrs. Thomas Forest, and her maid,
Ann Burras. The last named of these&mdash;the first Englishwomen in the
colony&mdash;became, before the close of the year, the wife of John Laydon.
This was the first marriage celebrated in Virginia. Newport had left England
under the silly pledge not to return without a lump of gold, or without
tidings of the discovery of a passage to the North Sea, or without the
rescue of one of the settlers of the lost company of Sir Walter Raleigh.
The Company added the equally impossible condition that he should bring
a freight in his vessel of equal value to the cost of the expedition, which
was £2,000. In case of failure in these respects, the colonists were to be
abandoned to their own resources. Much valuable time was consumed by
Newport in an idle coronation of Powhatan (for whose household he had
brought costly presents), and in futile efforts for the accomplishment of
the visionary expectations of the Company. At last there was provided
by those of the colonists who remained at their labors a part of a cargo
of pitch, tar, glass, and iron ore, and Newport set sail, leaving at Jamestown
about two hundred settlers. The iron ore which he carried was
smelted in England, and seventeen tons of metal sold to the East India
Company at £4 per ton. In the preservation of the colony until the next
arrival, the genius and energy of Smith were strongly but successfully
taxed,&mdash;for Captain Wynne dying, and Scrivener and Anthony Gosnold,
with eight others, having been drowned, he alone of the Council remained.
His measures were sagacious. Corn was planted, and blockhouses were
built and garrisoned at Jamestown for defence, and an outpost was established
at Hog Island, to give signal of the approach of shipping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last place the hogs, which increased rapidly, were kept. But being subject
to the treachery of the natives, the colonists were in continual danger of
attack, and were too slothful to make due provision for their wants, so that
the tenure of the settlement became like a brittle thread. The store of
provisions having been spoiled by damp or eaten by vermin, their subsistence
now depended precariously on fish, game, and roots. The prospects of the
colony were so discouraging at the beginning of the year 1609, that, in the
hope of improving them, the Company applied for a new charter with
enlarged privileges. This was granted to them, on the 23d of May, under
the corporate name of “The Treasurer and Company of Adventurers and
Planters of the City of London for the first Colony in Virginia.” The new
Association, which embraced representatives of every rank, trade, and profession,
included twenty-one peers, and its list of names presents an imposing
array of wealth and influence. By this charter Virginia was greatly
enlarged, and made to comprise the coast-line and all islands within one
hundred miles of it,&mdash;two hundred miles north and two hundred south of
Point Comfort,&mdash;with all the territory within parallel lines thus distant and
extending to the Pacific boundary; the Company was empowered to choose
the Supreme Council in England, and, under the instructions and regulations
of the last, the Governor was invested with absolute civil and military
authority.</p>

<p>With the disastrous experience
of the previous unstable system, a sterner
discipline seems, under attending circumstances,
to have been demanded to insure
success. Thomas West (Lord Delaware),
the descendant of a long line of noble ancestry,
received the appointment of Governor
and Captain-General of Virginia. The first expedition under the
second charter, which was on a grander scale than any preceding it, and
which consisted of nine vessels, sailed from Plymouth on the 1st of June,
1609.</p>

</div>

<p>Newport, the commander of the fleet, Sir Thomas Gates, Lieutenant-General,
and Sir George Somers, Admiral of Virginia,
were severally authorized, whichever of them
might first arrive at Jamestown, to supersede the
existing administration there until the arrival of
Lord Delaware, who was to embark some months later; but not being able
to settle the point of precedency among themselves, they embarked together
in the same vessel, which carried also the wife and daughters of Gates.
Among the five hundred colonists, were the returning Captains Ratcliffe,
Archer, and Martin, divers other captains and gentlemen, and, by the suggestion
of Hakluyt, a number of old soldiers<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> who had been trained in the
Netherlands. On the 23d of July the fleet was caught in a hurricane; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
small vessel was lost, others damaged, and the “Sea Venture,” which carried
Gates, Somers, and Newport, with about one hundred and fifty settlers, was
cast ashore on the Bermudas. Captain Samuel Argall (a relative of Sir
Thomas Smith) arrived at Jamestown in July, with a shipload of wine and
provisions, to trade on private account, contrary to the regulations of the
Company. As the settlers were suffering for food, they seized his supplies.
Many of them at this time had gone to live among the Indians, and eighty
had formed a settlement twenty miles distant from the fort. Early in
August the “Blessing,” Captain Archer, and three other vessels of the
delayed fleet sailed up James River, and soon after the “Diamond,”
Captain Ratcliffe, appeared,
without her mainmast, and
she was followed in a few
days by the “Swallow,” in
like condition.</p>

<p>The Council being all
dead save Smith, he, obtaining
the sympathy of the
sailors, refused to surrender
the government of the colony;
and the newly arrived
settlers elected Francis West,
the brother of Lord Delaware,
as temporary president.
The term of Smith
expiring soon after, George
Percy&mdash;one of the original
settlers, a brother of the
Earl of Northumberland,
and a brave and honorable
man&mdash;was elected president,
and West, Ratcliffe,
and Martin were made councillors.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Smith, about Michaelmas
(September 29), departed
for England or, as all contemporary accounts other than his own
state, was sent thither “to answer some misdemeanors.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> These were
doubtless of a venial character; but the important services of Smith in the
sustenance of the colony appear not to have been as highly esteemed by
the Company as by Smith himself. He complains that his several petitions
for reward were disregarded, and he never returned to Virginia. Modern
investigation has discredited many of the so-long-accepted narratives in
which he records his own achievements and judges so harshly the motives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and conduct of all others of his companions; and the glamour of romance
with which he invested his own exploits has been somewhat dissipated.
But whatever may have been the fervor of his imagination as a historian,
it was more than equalled by his fertility of resource in vital emergencies,
and there is ample evidence that his services in the preservation of the
infant colony were momentous. After his return to England but little is
recorded of him until the year 1614, during which he made a successful
voyage to New England, under the auspices of the Plymouth Company,
which gained for him the title of Admiral of New England.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Whatever
may have been the defects of Smith, the greatness of his deeds has impressed
him enduringly on the pages of history as one of the most prominent
figures of his period. At the time of his departure for England he
left at Jamestown three ships, seven boats, a good stock of provisions,
nearly five hundred settlers, twenty pieces of cannon, three hundred guns,
with fishing-nets, working-tools, horses, cattle, swine, etc.</p>

<p>Jamestown was strongly fortified with palisades, and contained between
fifty and sixty houses. The favorable prospects of the colony were soon
threatened by the renewal of Indian hostilities. Provisions becoming scarce,
West and Ratcliffe embarked in small vessels to procure corn. The latter,
deceived by the treachery of Powhatan, was slain with thirty of his companions,
two only escaping,&mdash;one of whom, Henry Spelman, a young
gentleman well descended, was rescued by Pocahontas, and lived for many
years among the Patowomekes. He acquired their language, and was
afterwards highly serviceable to his countrymen as an interpreter. He was
slain by the savages in 1622. No effort by tillage being made to replenish
their provisions, the stock was soon consumed, and the horrors of famine
were added to other calamities. The intense sufferings of the colonists
were long remembered, and this period is referred to as “the starving time.”
In six months their number was reduced to sixty, and such was the extremity
of these that they must soon have perished but for speedy succor.
The passengers of the wrecked “Sea Venture,” though mourned for as lost,
had effected a safe landing at the Bermudas, where, favored by the tropical
productions of the islands, they, under the direction of Gates and Somers,
constructed for their deliverance two vessels from the materials of the
wreck and cedar-wood, the largest of the vessels being of eighty tons burden.
The Sabbath was duly observed by them under the faithful ministry
of Mr. Bucke. Among the passengers was John Rolfe and wife,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> to whom
a male child was born on the island, who was christened Bermuda; a
girl also born there was named Bermudas. Six of the company, including
the wife of Sir Thomas Gates, died on the island. The company
of one hundred and forty men and women embarked on the completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
vessels&mdash;which were appropriately named the “Patience” and the “Deliverance”&mdash;on
the 10th of May, 1610, and on the 23d they landed at
Jamestown. Here the church bell was immediately rung, and such of
the famished colonists as were physically able repaired to the sanctuary,
where “a zealous and sorrowful prayer” was offered by Mr. Bucke. The
new commission being read, Percy, the acting president, surrendered the
former charter and his credentials of office. The fort was in a dismantled
condition, and most of the habitations had been consumed for fire-wood.
So forlorn was the condition of the settlement that Gates reluctantly resolved
to abandon it and to return to England by way of Newfoundland,
where he expected to receive succor from trading-vessels. Some of the
colonists were with difficulty restrained from setting fire to the town, Gates,
with a guard to prevent it, remaining on shore until all others had embarked.
A farewell volley was fired; but the leave-taking of a spot associated
with so much suffering was tearless.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the repeated ill tidings brought by returning ships
to England, and the supposed loss of the “Sea Venture” had so dismayed
the members of the Company in London that many of them withdrew
their subscriptions. Lord Delaware&mdash;who is characterized in the “Declaration”
of the Council, in 1610, as “one of approved courage, temper,
and experience”&mdash;determined to go in person as Governor and Captain-General
of Virginia (the first of such title and authority), and, disregarding
the comforts of home and noble station, “did bare a grate part upon
his owne charge.” By his example, constancy, and resolution, “that
which was almost lifeless” was revived in the Company. On Feb. 21,
1609-10, William Crashaw, a preacher at the Temple (the father of the
poet eulogized by Cowley), in view of the departure of Lord Delaware,
delivered before the Council and Adventurers in London a stirring sermon,
which was the first preached in England to any embarking for Virginia
in a missionary cause.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Distinct and unequivocal testimony is given
by the Company, in the “Declaration” already cited, as to the reputation
of settlers for the colony, none being desired but those of blameless
character. Five weeks later Lord Delaware sailed with three vessels and
one hundred and fifty settlers, and arrived in Virginia providentially to
intercept, off Mulberry Island, Gates and his disheartened companions as
they were descending the river, who returned at once to Jamestown.
The fleet, following, arrived there on Sunday, the 10th of June. The
first act of Lord Delaware upon landing was to fall devoutly upon his
knees and offer up a prayer, after which he repaired with the company
to the church, to listen to a sermon by Mr. Bucke. Two days later a
council was organized, consisting of Sir Thomas Gates, lieutenant-general,
Sir Thomas Somers, admiral, Sir Ferdinando Wenman, master of ordnance
(who soon died), Captain Newport, vice-admiral, Captain George Percy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and William Strachey, secretary and recorder. Captain John Martin was
made master of the steel and iron works. The restoration of the settlement
was prosecuted with vigor, and the church, a building sixty feet in
length by twenty-four in breadth, was repaired, and services were held
regularly twice on Sunday, and again on Thursday. Two forts were also
built on Southampton River, and called after the King’s sons, Henry and
Charles, respectively.</p>

<p>The administration of Delaware, though ludicrously ostentatious for so
insignificant a dominion, was yet highly wholesome, and under his judicious
discipline the settlement was restored to order and contentment. On the
19th of June Sir George Somers, in his cedar pinnace, accompanied by
Argall in another vessel, re-embarked to seek for provisions. The vessels
separating, Argall on the 27th of August “came to anchor in nine fathoms,
in a very great bay,” called by him Delaware,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and on the ninth of the
month reached Cape Charles. Somers, soon after parting from Argall,
reached the Bermudas, where, dying from the effects of the hardships he
had undergone, his body was embalmed and conveyed to England by his
nephew, Captain Matthew Somers. About Christmas, Captain Argall sailed
in the “Discovery” up the Potomac for supplies of corn, and rescued
the captive English boy Henry Spelman from Jopassus, the brother of
Powhatan. In the month of February following, Argall, aided by a small
land force under Captain Edward Brewster, attacked the chief of the Warraskoyacks
for a breach of contract and burned two of his towns. Sir
Thomas Gates, being despatched to England to report to the Company the
condition of the colony, succeeded by strenuous appeals in inducing it to
send a fresh supply of settlers and provisions. During his absence, the
health of Lord Delaware failing, on the 28th of March, 1611, accompanied
by Dr. Bohune and Captain Argall, he sailed for England by way of the
Isle of Mevis, leaving Percy in authority. On the 17th of March Sir
Thomas Dale, with the appointment of “high marshall,” had sailed with
three vessels for the colony, with settlers (among whom was the Rev.
Alexander Whitaker) and cattle. He reached Point Comfort May the 12th,
and spent several days in provisioning and disciplining that station and
the forts Henry and Charles on the Southampton River, and in planting
corn.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas landed at Jamestown on Sunday the 19th, where, first repairing
to the church, he listened to a sermon from the Rev. Mr. Poole, after
which, his commission being read by Secretary Strachey, Percy surrendered
the government to him. Under an extraordinary code of “Lawes, Divine,
Morall, and Martiall,” compiled by William Strachey for Sir Thomas Smith,
and based upon those observed in the wars in the Low Countries, Dale
inaugurated vigorous measures for the government and advancement of
the colony. The church was repaired, and store, powder, and block houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
severally were built, while pales and posts were prepared for a new settlement.
The site selected for the last was a peninsula in Varina Neck on
James River, known as Farrar’s Island, which is formed by an extraordinary
curve resembling that of a horseshoe, where the river, after a sweep
of seven miles, returns to a point within a hundred and twenty yards from
that of its deviation. The name of the bend, Dutch Gap,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> by the events
of the late civil war attained a historic notoriety. The building of the new
town was delayed by insubordination among the colonists, which however,
under the rigors of the martial code in force, was promptly quelled, eight
of the ringleaders being executed. The pernicious system of a community
of property was now to some extent remedied by Dale, in the allotment
to each settler of three acres of land to be worked for his individual
benefit. “Comon gardens for hemp and flaxe, and such other seedes,”
were also laid out.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>In June, 1611, Sir Thomas Gates, accompanied by his wife (who died
on the passage) and daughters and the Rev. Mr. Glover (who lived but a
short time after his arrival in the colony), followed Dale with six ships,
three hundred settlers, and one hundred cows, besides other cattle and an
abundant supply of provisions. He arrived at Jamestown early in August,
and thus increased the number of the colonists to seven hundred persons.
Gates established himself at Hampton, deputed the command of Jamestown
to Percy, and sent Dale, early in September, with three hundred and fifty
men, to found the projected town of Henrico, at which, among the “three
streets” of buildings erected, was a handsome church. The foundation of
another, to be of brick, was laid.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> In December, the Appomattox Indians
having committed some depredations, Dale captured their town on the south
side of the James, near the mouth of Appomattox River (and about five
miles distant from Henrico), and upon its site established a third town,
which he called Bermuda. Here the pious apostle Alexander Whitaker
fixed his residence, serving as the minister both of Bermuda and Henrico.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
Several plantations were laid out near Bermuda,&mdash;Upper and Lower Rochdale,
West Shirley, and Digges’ Hundred. In conformity with the code of
martial law, each hundred was subjected to the control of a captain. In
December, also, Newport arrived at London from Jamestown, in the ship
“Star,” with a cargo of “forty fine and large pines for masts,” and with the
daughters of Sir Thomas Gates as passengers. Newport’s name does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
again appear in connection with Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The reinforcements for the
colony for some months were insignificant, the only ships sent over being
the “John and Francis” and the “Sarah,” with few settlers and less provisions,
and the “Treasurer” with fifty persons, under the bold and unscrupulous
Captain Samuel Argall, who, sailing from England in July, 1612,
arrived at Point Comfort, September 17.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> This year was a marked one
in the inauguration by John Rolfe of the systematic culture of tobacco,&mdash;a
staple destined to exert a controlling influence in the future welfare
and progress of the colony, and soon, by the paramount profit yielded by
its culture, to subordinate all other interests, agricultural as well as manufacturing.
This influence permeated the entire social fabric of the colony,
directed its laws, was an element in all its political and religious disturbances,
and became the direct instigation of its curse of African slavery. It
may be added, however, as an indisputable fact, that the culture of tobacco
constituted the basis of the present unrivalled prosperity of the United
States, and that this staple is still one of the most prolific factors in the
revenue of the General Government.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1613, the colonists needing food, Argall determined
on a bold stroke, and with the bribe of a copper kettle induced Jopassus,
the king of Potomac, in whose domain Pocahontas was sojourning, to betray
her into his hands. Having sent a messenger to Powhatan, demanding as
a ransom the restoration of all English captives held by him, and of all arms
and tools stolen from the settlement, Argall returned with his captive to
Jamestown. There was a protracted struggle in the breast of the savage
chieftain between avarice and parental affection.</p>

<p>Some months later Dale, with a command of one hundred and fifty men,
sailed up York River to Werowocomico, the seat of Powhatan, carrying
Pocahontas with him. Meeting with defiance, he landed and destroyed the
settlement, and then returned to Jamestown. The ship “Elizabeth” arriving
in March with thirteen settlers, Sir Thomas Gates departed in her for
England finally, leaving the government to Dale. An event most auspicious
for the future welfare of the colony soon occurred. A mutual
attachment springing up between John Rolfe and Pocahontas, with the
consent of Sir Thomas Dale they were united in marriage by the Rev.
Alexander Whitaker, about the 5th of April, 1614. This was a politic example,
which Dale himself unsuccessfully attempted to follow, although he
had then a wife in England. Sending Ralph Hamor (who had been secretary
of the Council under Lord Delaware) to Powhatan, with a request for
the younger sister of Pocahontas, a girl scarce twelve years of age, his overtures
were disdainfully rejected. The results of the union of Rolfe and
Pocahontas were the good-will of Powhatan during the remainder of his life,
and a treaty of peace with the formidable Chickahominy tribe, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the natives agreed ever to be called Englishmen, and to be true subjects
to the British crown. With the immunity of peace, and under the wholesome
discipline of Dale, industry was stimulated, property accumulated,
and famine was no longer feared. Prosperity being now seemingly assured
to the colony, the martial spirit of Dale sought other modes of manifesting
itself. As early as 1605 the French had sent settlers to Acadia, and
planted a colony at Port Royal, which had now attained some prominence.</p>

It is of red wax between the leaves of a foolscap
sheet of paper, and is affixed to a patent for land
issued by Sir John Harvey, governor, dated
March 4, 1638.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This being deemed by Dale an invasion of the territory of Virginia, which
by charter extended to the forty-fifth degree of latitude, he sent Argall to
dislodge the settlers, which was summarily accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Stimulated to
new conquests, Argall on his return visited the Dutch settlement near the
site of Albany, on the Hudson, and compelled its governor to capitulate.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
It was however soon after reclaimed by the Dutch. Argall now sailed for
England, where he and Gates both arrived in June, 1614. In March, 1612,
a third charter had been granted to the Virginia Company, extending the
boundaries of the colony so as to include all islands lying within three hundred
leagues of the continent,&mdash;one object of which was to embrace the
Bermuda or Summer Islands, of the fertility of which extravagant accounts
had been given; but these last were soon after sold by the Company to one
hundred and twenty of its members, who became a distinct corporation.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The privilege of holding lotteries for the benefit of the Company was also
secured. Gates reporting that the colony in Virginia would perish unless
better provided, the Company held for its relief a grand lottery, by which
the sum of £29,000 was secured. The year 1615 is remarkable in the
history of Virginia for the first establishment of a fixed property in the
soil, in the granting by the Company of fifty acres to every freeman in
absolute right.</p>


<p>Good order being established, and the colony prosperous, in April, 1616,
Sir Thomas Dale, leaving the government to Captain George Yeardley as his
deputy, accompanied by Rolfe, Pocahontas, and several Indians of both
sexes, sailed for England, where he arrived on the 12th of June. The settlements
in Virginia at this time were Henrico, the seat of the college for
the education of the natives (of whom children of both sexes were already
being taught), and of which the Rev. William Wickham was the minister,&mdash;its
limits being Bermuda, Nether Hundred, or Presquile, the residence of
the Deputy-Governor Yeardley and of the Rev. Alexander Whitaker; West
and Shirley Hundred, Captain Isaac Madison, commander; Jamestown,
Captain Francis West, Mr. Mease, minister; Kiquotan; and Dale’s Gift, on
the sea-coast near Cape Charles, Lieutenant Cradock, commander. The
total population of the colony was three hundred and fifty-one.</p>

<p>Pocahontas was the object of much kindly attention in London, where
she was presented at court by Lady Delaware, attended by Lord Delaware,
her husband, and other persons of quality. In March, 1617, John Rolfe prepared
to return to Virginia with Pocahontas and their infant child Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
but on the eve of embarkation Pocahontas was stricken with the small-pox,
of which she died on the 21st instant, aged twenty-two years, and was buried
at Gravesend, in the county of Kent.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Tobacco proving the most salable
commodity of the colony, in 1616 Yeardley directed general attention to its
culture, the profit of which speedily became so alluring that all other occupations
were forsaken for it.</p>

<p>Through the influence of the court faction of the Company, in 1617,
Captain Samuel Argall was elected Deputy-Governor of Virginia. He arrived
in the colony on the 15th of May, with one hundred settlers, accompanied by
Ralph Hamor as Vice-Admiral, and John Rolfe as “Secretary and Recorder-General.”
They found “the market-place, streets, and all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
spare places” in Jamestown planted with tobacco.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> In a few days thereafter
Captain Martin also arrived in a pinnace, after a passage of five weeks.
The whole number of the colonists was now about four hundred. To
reinforce the languishing colony, the Company, in April, 1618, sent thither
Lord Delaware, the Governor-General, in the ship “Neptune,” with two
hundred men, and supplies. After his departure the ship “George” arrived
from Virginia with such complaints of the malfeasance of Argall, who
under martial law had loaded the colonists with oppressive exactions and
robbed them of their property, that letters were despatched to Lord Delaware
to seize upon all goods and
property in Argall’s possession.
Lord Delaware dying on the passage,
these letters fell into the
hands of Argall, who, to make
the most of his remaining time,
grew yet more tyrannical. For
seizing one of the servants of
the estate of Lord Delaware, on
the complaint of Edward Brewster,
the son of its manager, Argall
was arrested, and on the
15th of October, 1618, tried and
sentenced to death; but the penalty
was commuted to perpetual
banishment. He secretly stole
away from the colony April the
9th, 1619, leaving Captain Nathaniel
Powell in authority. Upon
the intelligence of the death
of Lord Delaware, Captain
George Yeardley, who was
knighted on the occasion, was appointed
to succeed him. Sir Edwin Sandys also displaced Sir Thomas
Smith as treasurer of the Company.</p>

was alive in 1644, and is called Dame Cecily
Dowager de la Warre in the sixth <i>Report of the
Historical Commission</i> to Parliament, in a paper
in which the continuance of her pension is asked
for.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Yeardley arrived in the colony April the 19th with a new authority under
the charter, by which the authority of the governor was limited by a council
and an annual general assembly, to be composed of the Governor and Council,
and two burgesses from each plantation, to be freely elected by the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thereof. John Rolfe, who was succeeded in the office of Secretary
of the Colony by John Pory, a graduate of Cambridge, a great traveller and
a writer, was, with Captain Francis West, Captain Nathaniel Powell, William
Wickham, and Samuel Macock, added to the Council. On Friday, July 30,
1619, in accordance with the summons of Governor Yeardley in June, the
first representative legislative assembly ever held in America was convened
in the chancel of the church at James City or Jamestown, and was composed
of twenty-two burgesses from the eleven several towns, plantations, and
hundreds, styled boroughs. The proceedings were opened with prayer
by the Rev. Mr. Bucke, and each burgess took the oath of supremacy.
John Pory was elected speaker, and sat in front of Governor Yeardley,
and next was John Twine, the clerk, and at the bar stood Thomas Pierse,
sergeant-at-arms. The delegates from Captain John Martin’s plantation
were excluded, because by his patent, granted according to the unequal
privilege of the manors of England, he was released from obeying any
order of the colony except in time of war and the Company was
prayed that the clause in the charter guaranteeing equal immunities
and liberties might not be violated, so as to “divert out of the true
course the free and public current of justice.” The education and religious
instruction of the children of the natives was enjoined upon each
settlement. Among the enactments, tobacco was authorized as a currency,
and the treasurer of the colony (Abraham Percy) was directed to receive it
at the valuation of three shillings per pound for the best, and eighteen-pence
for the second quality. The government of ministers was prescribed
according to the Church of England, and a tax of tobacco laid for their
support. It was also enacted that “all persons whatsoever upon the Sabbath
days shall frequent divine service and sermons, both forenoon and
afternoon.” To compensate the officers of the Assembly, a tax of a pound
of tobacco was laid upon every male above sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>The introduction of negro slavery into the colony is thus noted by John
Rolfe: “About the last of August [1619] came in a Dutch man of warre,
that sold us twenty Negars.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> During this year there were sent to the colony
more than twelve hundred settlers, and one hundred “disorderly persons”
or convicts, by order of the King, to be employed as servants. Boys and
girls picked up in the streets of London were also sent, and were bound
as apprentices<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> to the planters until the age of majority. In June twenty
thousand pounds of tobacco, the crop of the preceding year, was shipped to
England. In November the London Company adopted a coat-of-arms, and
ordered a seal to be engraved.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The Company appears ever to have held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in due regard the importance of education as intimately connected with
the preservation and dissemination of Christianity in the colony. Under an
order from the King, nearly £1,500 were collected by the bishops of the
realm to build the college at Henrico, and fifteen thousand acres of land
were appropriated for its support.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> To cultivate it during the years 1619
and 1620 one hundred laborers were sent over under the charge of Mr.
George Thorpe (a kinsman of Sir Thomas Dale) and Captain Thomas
Newce as agents. At a meeting of the Company held June 28, 1620,
the Earl of Southampton was elected to succeed Sir Edwin Sandys as
treasurer.</p>

<p>The population of the colony in July was estimated at four thousand,
and during the year forty thousand pounds of tobacco were shipped to
England. The freedom of trade which the Company had enjoyed for a
brief interval with the Low Countries, where they sold their tobacco, was in
October, 1621, prohibited in Council, and thenceforward England claimed
a monopoly of the trade of her plantations. The planters at length were
absolved from service to the Company, and enjoyed the blessings of property
in the soil and of domestic felicity. In the autumn of 1621 the
practice was begun by the Company of shipping to the colony young
women of respectability as wives for the colonists, who were chargeable
with the cost of transportation. This charge was at first one hundred and
twenty, afterwards one hundred and fifty, pounds of tobacco. A windmill,
the first in America, was about this time erected by Sir George Yeardley,
and iron-works (the primal inauguration of this essential manufacture
in this country) were established at Falling Creek on James River, under
the management of Mr. John Berkeley.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Upon the request of Sir George Yeardley to be relieved of the cares of
office, Sir Francis Wyatt was appointed to succeed him upon the expiration
of his term of government on the 18th of November, 1621. Sir Francis,
with a fleet of nine sail, arrived in October, accompanied by his brother,
the Rev. Haut Wyatt, Dr John Pott as physician, William Claiborne (destined
to later prominence in the colony) as surveyor of the Company’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lands, and George Sandys<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as treasurer, who during his stay translated the
<i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid and the First Book of Virgil’s <i>Æneid</i>. This first
Anglo-American poetical production was published in 1626. Sir Francis
Wyatt brought with him a new constitution for the colony, granted
July 24, by which all former immunities and franchises were confirmed,
trial by jury was secured, and the Assembly was to meet annually upon
the call of the Governor, who was vested with the right of veto. No act of
this body was to be valid unless ratified by the Company; but, on the other
hand, no order of the Company was to be obligatory without the concurrence
of the Assembly. This famous ordinance furnished the model of
every subsequent provincial form of government in the Anglo-American
colonies.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In November Daniel Gookin arrived from Ireland with fifty
settlers under his control and thirty-six passengers, and planted himself
in Elizabeth City County, at Mary’s Mount, just above Newport News.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
There arrived during the year twenty-one vessels, bringing over thirteen
hundred men, women, and children. The aggregate number of settlers
arriving during the years 1619, 1620, and 1621 was thirty-five hundred and
seventy.</p>

<p>Deluded by long peace, on the 22d of March, 1622, the unsuspecting
colonists fell easy victims to a frightful Indian massacre of men, women,
and children, to the number of three hundred and forty-seven. Among the
slain were Mr. George Thorpe, the agent for the college at Henrico, and
Mr. John Berkeley, master of the iron-works at Falling Creek.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Their
death and the destruction of their charges terminated the prosecution of
these material measures for the good of the colony. The future policy
with the savages was aggressive until the peace of 1632. At an Assembly
held in March, 1623, monthly courts to be appointed by the Governor
were authorized. The Virginia Company, in their opposition to the King
in the nomination of their officers, had already incurred his ill-will, which
was increased by the freedom with which they discussed public measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
so as to invoke his denunciation of them as “but a seminary to a seditious
parliament.” Violent factions divided them, and the massacre came at
a juncture to fan discontent. Commissioners were sent to Virginia by the
King to gather materials for the ruin of the Company. The result was
the annulling of its charter by the King’s Bench on the 16th of June, 1624.
Sir Francis Wyatt was continued as governor by commission from King
James, dated Aug. 26, 1624, and again in May, 1625, by the young monarch,
Charles I., who appointed as councillors for the colony, during his
pleasure, Francis West, Sir George Yeardley, George Sandys, Roger Smith,
Ralph Hamor, John Martin, John Harvey, Samuel Matthews, Abraham
Percy, Isaac Madison, and William Claiborne. He omitted all mention
of an assembly, and there is no preserved record of the meeting of this
body again until 1629. The administration of Wyatt was wise and pacific.
The death of his father, Sir George Wyatt, calling him to Ireland, he was
succeeded, in May, 1626, by Sir George Yeardley, who dying Nov. 14,
1627, the Council elected as his successor, on the following day, Francis
West, a younger brother of Lord Delaware. West, departing for England
on the 5th of March, 1628, was succeeded by Dr. John Pott. The export
of tobacco in 1628 was five hundred thousand pounds. Charles, desiring
a monopoly of the trade, directed an assembly to be called to grant it.
That body, replying the 26th of March, demanded a higher price and more
favorable terms than his Majesty was disposed to yield. The colony
rapidly increased in strength and prosperity, the population in 1629 being
five thousand. Pott was superseded as governor in March, 1630, by Sir
John Harvey, who had been one of the commissioners sent in 1623 to procure
evidence to be used against the Virginia Company. Between him
and the colonists there was but little good-will, and his arbitrary rule soon
rendered him odious.</p>

<p>In July, by a strange mutation of fortune, Pott, the
late governor, was tried
for cattle-stealing, and
convicted. This was the
first trial by jury in the
colony. It was in 1630
that George Calvert, with
his followers, arrived in
the colonies; but the details of his experience here and of the disputes
about jurisdiction arising out of the grant of the present territory of Maryland,
made to him and confirmed to his son in 1632, are given in another
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> It was under successive grants from the governors in 1627, 1628,
and 1629, and from Charles I. in 1631, that William Claiborne had established
his trading-posts in the disputed territory, from which he was driven
with bloodshed, and by the final decree of the King in 1639 despoiled of
£6,000 of property. Harvey&mdash;actuated, it has been charged, by motives
of private interest&mdash;sided with Maryland in the disputes, and rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
himself so obnoxious that an assembly was called for the 7th of May,
1635, to hear complaints against him. Before it met, however, he consented
to go to England to answer the charges, and was “thrust out of
his government” by the Council on the 28th of April, and Captain John
West, a brother of Lord Delaware, was authorized to act as his successor
until the King’s pleasure might be known. In 1634 the colony was
divided into eight shires,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> subject, as in England, to the government of
a lieutenant.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The election of sheriffs, sergeants, and bailiffs was similarly
provided for. The King, intolerant of opposition, reinstated the hated
Harvey as governor, by commission dated April 2, 1636.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> During his
rule of three years thereafter, no assembly was held. Charles gradually
relaxed his policy, and in November, 1639, displaced Harvey with Sir
Francis Wyatt, who in turn was
succeeded by Sir William Berkeley
as governor in February,
1642. During the year three
Congregational ministers came from Boston to Virginia to disseminate
their doctrines.</p>

</div>

<p>Their stay, however, was but short; for by an enactment
of the Assembly all ministers other than those of the Church of
England were compelled to leave the colony. It will be shown that their
success was limited. On the 18th of April, 1644, a second Indian massacre
occurred. The number of victims has been differently stated as three and
five hundred. During a visit by Berkeley to England, from June, 1644, to
June, 1645, his place was filled by Richard Kemp. In 1642 the ship of
Richard Ingle, from London, had been seized by Governor Brent, of
Maryland, acting under a commission from Charles I., and an oath against
Parliament tendered the crew. Ingle escaped, and, securing a commission
from Parliament to cruise in the waters of the Chesapeake against Malignants,
as the friends of the King were called, reappeared in February, 1645,
in the ship “Reformation,” near St. Inigo Creek, where there was a popular
uprising, and with the aid of the insurgents and forces from Virginia expelled
Leonard Calvert and installed Colonel Edward Hill as governor.
Calvert regained authority in August, 1646. The colony of Virginia continued
to prosper. In 1648 the population consisted of fifteen thousand
whites and three hundred negro slaves. Domestic animals were abundant;
corn, wheat, rice, hemp, flax, and many vegetables were cultivated; there
were fifteen varieties of fruit, and excellent wine was made. The average
export of tobacco for several years had been 1,500,000 pounds. Besides
the “old field schools,” there was a free school endowed by Benjamin
Symmes with two hundred acres of land, a good house, forty milch cows,
and other appurtenances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dissenters, who had increased in number to one hundred and
eighteen, now encountered the rigors of colonial authority in imprisonment
and banishment, and all opposition to the Established Church was
decisively quelled.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>With the beheading of Charles I. on the 30th of January, 1649, the
Commonwealth of England was inaugurated; but Virginia still continued
its allegiance to his son, the exiled prince, and offered an asylum to his
fugitive adherents. Three hundred and thirty of these, including Colonel
Henry Norwood and Majors Francis Morrison and Richard Fox, arrived
near the close of 1649 in the “Virginia Merchant.”</p>

<p>Norwood was sent the following year by Berkeley to Holland to invite
the fugitive King to Virginia as its ruler, and returned from Breda with
a new commission for Berkeley as governor, dated June 3, and another for
himself as treasurer of the colony, in approbation of the loyalty manifested.
Charles II. was crowned by the Scotch at Scone in 1651, and, invading
England with his followers, was utterly overthrown and defeated at Worcester,
September 3. In the same month the Council of State issued
instructions to Captain Robert Dennis, Richard Bennet, Thomas Steg,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and
William Claiborne, as commissioners for the reduction of Virginia to the
authority of the Commonwealth. Captain Dennis arrived at Jamestown
in March, 1652, and the capitulation of the colony was ratified on the
12th instant upon liberal terms, which confirmed the existing privileges
of the colonists and granted indemnity for all offences against Parliament.
The commissioners Bennet and Claiborne soon after effected the reduction
of Maryland, but with singular moderation allowed its Governor and Council
to retain their offices upon the simple condition of issuing all writs in the
name of the Commonwealth. A provisional government was organized in
Virginia, on the 30th of April, by the election by the House of Burgesses
of Richard Bennet as governor and William Claiborne as secretary of state,
and a council of twelve, whose powers were to be defined by the Grand
Assembly, of which they were ex-officio members.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of individual enterprise was given in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
part of 1654 by Francis Yeardley,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> who effected discoveries in North
Carolina, and at the cost of £300 purchased from the natives “three
great rivers and all such others as they should like southerly,” and took
possession of the country in the name of the Commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In March,
1655, Richard Bennet was appointed the agent of the colony at London,
and was succeeded as governor by Edward Digges. In 1656 Colonel
Edward Hill the elder, in endeavoring with one hundred men to dislodge
seven hundred Ricahecrian Indians who had seated themselves at the
Falls of James River, was utterly routed. Bloody Run, near Richmond,
significantly derives its name from this encounter. On the 13th of March,
1657, Edward Digges was sent to London as the agent of the colony,
and was succeeded as governor by Samuel Matthews. The government
of the colony under the Commonwealth was beneficent, and the people
were prosperous.</p>

<p>Upon the reception of the intelligence of the death of Oliver and of the
accession of Richard Cromwell as Protector, obedience was acknowledged
by the Assembly on the 9th of March, 1658. Richard Cromwell resigned
on the 22d of April, 1659, and Matthews had died in January previously.
England was for a time without a monarch, and Virginia without a governor.
The Virginia Assembly, convening on the 23d of March, 1660, elected Sir
William Berkeley as governor, and declared that all writs should be issued
in the name of the Grand Assembly. On the 8th of May Charles II.
was proclaimed as King in England, and on the 31st of July following
he transmitted a new commission to his faithful adherent, Sir William
Berkeley. In March, 1661, 44,000 pounds of tobacco were appropriated
by the Assembly to defray the cost of an address to the King, praying him
to pardon the inhabitants of Virginia for having yielded during the Commonwealth
to a force they could not resist. And in contrition for their
tacit submission to the “execrable power that so bloodily massacred the
late King Charles the First of blessed and glorious memory,” it was
enacted that “the 30th of January, the day the said King was beheaded,
be annually solemnized with fasting and prayer, that our sorrows may
expiate our crime, and our tears wash away our guilt.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> A little later, the
29th of May, the date of the restoration of Charles II., was decreed to be
celebrated annually as a “holy day.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Berkeley being sent on the 30th of April, 1661, by the colony to England
to protest against the enforcement of the Navigation Act, Colonel
Francis Morrison was elected in his stead. Berkeley returned in the fall
of 1662 with advantageous patents for himself, but without relief for the
colony. Colonel William Claiborne, secretary of state, was displaced by
Thomas Ludwell, commissioned by the King. Colonel Francis Morrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and Henry Randolph, clerk of the Assembly, were appointed to revise the
laws, and it was ordered that all acts which “might keep in memory our
forced deviation from his Majesty’s obedience” should be “expunged.”
A satisfactory account of the condition of the colony in 1670 is afforded
in a report made by Governor Berkeley to the Lords Commissioners of
Foreign Plantations. The executive consisted of the Governor and sixteen
councillors commissioned by the King, who determined all causes above
£15; causes of less amount were tried by the county courts, of which
there were twenty. The Assembly, composed of two burgesses from each
county, met annually; it levied the taxes, and appeals lay to it. The legislative
and executive powers rested in the Governor, Council, Assembly,
and subordinate officers. The Acts of the Assembly were sent by the
secretary of the colony to the Lord Chancellor. All freemen were bound
to muster monthly in their own counties. The force of the colony
numbered upwards of eight thousand horsemen. There were five forts,
mounted with thirty cannon.</p>

<p>The whole population was forty thousand, of which two thousand were
negro slaves, and six thousand white servants. Eighty vessels arrived
yearly from England and Ireland for tobacco; a few small coasters came
from New England. The annual exportation of tobacco was 15,000 hogsheads
(about 12,000,000 pounds), upon which a duty of two shillings a
hogshead was levied. Out of this revenue the Governor received as salary
£1,200. The King had no revenue from the colony except the quit-rents.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
There were forty-eight parishes, the ministers of which were well paid. Under
the monopoly of the Navigation Act the price of tobacco was greatly
depressed, the cost of imported goods enhanced, and the trade of the colony
almost extinguished; yet the profligate King oppressed the colonists still
further, and by a grant of the whole territory of Virginia to Lords Arlington
and Culpeper they found themselves deprived of the very titles to the lands
they owned. The privilege of franchise was even virtually withheld, for
there had been no election of burgesses since the Restoration in 1660, the
same legislature having continued to hold its sessions by prorogation. The
colonists grew so impatient under their accumulated grievances that a
revolt was near bursting forth in 1674. It was quieted for a time by some
pacific concessions; but the fires only slumbered, and an immediate
grievance and a popular leader were alone required to produce revolutionary
measures. The severity of the policy against the Indians incensed
them to hostility, and the lives of the colonists were in constant jeopardy.
They petitioned the Governor for protection, and on the meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Assembly in March, 1676, war was declared against the Indians, and
a force of five hundred men raised and put under the command of Sir
Henry Chicheley to subdue them; but when he was about to march he
was suddenly and without apparent cause ordered by Berkeley to disband
his forces. The Indians continued their murders until sixty lives had been
sacrificed. The alarmed colonists, having in vain petitioned the Governor
for protection, rose tumultuously in self-defence, including quite all the
civil and military officers of the colony, and chose Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., as
their leader. Bacon, who was of the distinguished English family of that
name, had been but a short time in the colony; but he was a member of the
Council, brave, rich, eloquent, and popular. He had an immediate stimulant,
too, in the murder at his plantation, near the site of Richmond, of his
overseer and a favorite servant.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Bacon, fruitlessly applying for a commission,
marched at the head of five hundred men against the savages; and
in the mean time Berkeley proclaimed them as traitors and ineffectually
pursued them with an armed force. Bacon replied in a declaration denouncing
the Governor as a tyrant and traitor to his King and the country.
During Berkeley’s absence the planters in the lower counties rose, and, the
revolt becoming general, he was forced to return, when he endeavored to
quiet the storm. Writs for a new Assembly were issued, to which Bacon
was elected. He, having punished the savages, while on his way to the
Assembly was arrested in James River by an armed vessel, but was soon
released on parole. When the Assembly met on the 5th of June, he read at
the bar a written confession and apology for his conduct, and was thereupon
pardoned and readmitted to his seat in the Council. He was also promised
a commission to proceed against the Indians; but, being secretly informed
of a plot by the Governor against his life, he fled, returning however to
Jamestown in a few days with a large force, when, appealing to the Assembly,
they declared him their general, vindicated his course, and sent a letter to
England approving it. They also passed salutary laws of reform. Berkeley
resisted, dissolved them, and in turn addressed the King. Bacon,
all-powerful, having extorted a commission from the Governor, marched
against the Indians. Berkeley once more proclaimed him as a traitor.
Bacon, on hearing it, in the midst of a successful campaign returned; and
Berkeley, deserted by his troops, fled to Accomac. Bacon, now supreme,
called together, by an invitation signed by himself and four of the Council,
a convention of the principal gentlemen of the colony, at the Middle
Plantation, to consult for defence against the savages and protection against
the tyranny of Berkeley. He also issued a reply to the proclamation of
Berkeley, in which he vindicates himself in lofty strains.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> He now again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
marched against the Indians; but in his absence a fleet which he had sent
to capture Berkeley was betrayed, and the Governor returned to Jamestown
at the head of the forces sent to capture him. Bacon now returned,
and Berkeley, deserted by his men, fleeing again to Accomac, Bacon
triumphantly entered Jamestown and burned the State House. He died
shortly afterwards from disease contracted by exposure, and his followers,
left without a leader, dispersed, and Berkeley was finally dominant. On
the 29th of February, 1677, a fleet with a regiment of soldiers, commanded
by Colonels Herbert Jeffreys and Francis Morrison, arrived in the colony
to quell the rebellion. Jeffreys, Morrison, and Berkeley sat as a commission
to try the insurgents. They were vindictively punished: the jails were
filled, estates confiscated, and twenty-three persons executed. At length
the Assembly, in an address to the Governor, deprecated any further
sanguinary punishments, and he was prevailed upon, reluctantly, to desist.
All the acts of the Assembly of June, 1676, called Bacon’s Laws, were
repealed, though many of them were afterwards re-enacted. Berkeley,
being recalled by the King, sailed for England on the 27th of April,
1677, and was succeeded by Sir Herbert Jeffreys as governor. Jeffreys
effected a treaty with the Indians, but dying in December, 1678, was succeeded
by Sir Henry Chicheley, who in turn gave place, on the 10th of
May, 1680, to Lord Culpeper, who had been appointed in July, 1675,
governor of Virginia for life. Virginia was now tranquil. The resources
of the country continued to be developed. The production and export
of tobacco&mdash;the chief staple&mdash;steadily increased, and with it the prosperity
of the colony. The ease with which wealth was acquired fostered
the habits of personal indulgence and ostentatious expenditure into which
the Virginia planter was led by hereditary characteristics.</p>

<p>Undue stress has been laid by many historians upon the transportation
of “convicts” to the colony. Such formed but a small proportion of the
population, and it is believed that the offence of a majority of them was of
a political nature. Be it as it may, all dangerous or debasing effect of their
presence was effectually guarded against by rigorous enactments. The vile
among them met the fate of the vicious, while the simply unfortunate who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
were industrious throve and became good citizens. It is clearly indicated
that the aristocratic element of the colony preponderated.</p>

<p>The under stratum of society, formed by the “survival of the fittest”
of the “indentured servant” and the “convict” classes, as they improved
in worldly circumstances, rose to the surface and took their places socially
and politically among the more favored class. The Virginia planter was
essentially a transplanted Englishman in tastes and convictions, and emulated
the social amenities and the culture of the mother country.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Thus
in time was formed a society distinguished for its refinement, executive
ability, and a generous hospitality, for which the Ancient Dominion is
proverbial.</p>

<h3><a name="c153" id="c153">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE is abundant evidence, as instanced by Mr. Deane in a paper in the <i>Boston
Daily Advertiser</i>, July 31, 1877, that the name of Virginia commemorates Elizabeth,
the virgin queen of England. Mr. Deane’s paper was in answer to a fanciful belief, expressed
by Mr. C. W. Tuttle in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1877, that the Indian name Wingina,
mentioned by Hakluyt, may have suggested the appellation.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The early patents are given
in Purchas (abstract of the first), iv. 1683-84; Stith; Hazard’s <i>Historical Collections</i>, i. 50,

<p>See a paper by L. W. Tazewell, on the “Limits of Virginia under the Charters,” in Maxwell’s
<i>Virginia Historical Register</i>, i. 12. These bounds were relied on for Virginia’s
claims at a later day to the Northwest Territory. Cf. H. B. Adams’s <i>Maryland’s Influence
in Founding a National Commonwealth</i>, or Maryland Historical Society Publication Fund,

<i>United States</i>, p. 86, gives a convenient map of the grants by the English crown from
1606 to 1732. Mr. Deane has discussed the matter of forms used in issuing letters patent
in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> xi. 166.</p>

<p>The earliest printed account of the settlement at Jamestown, covering the interval
April 26, 1607-June 2, 1608, is entitled: <i>A True Relation of such occurrences and accidents
of noate as hath hapned in Virginia since the first planting of that Collony which
is now resident in the South part thereof, till the last returne from thence. Written by
Captaine Smith, Coronell of the said Collony, to a worshipfull friend of his in England</i>.
Small quarto, black letter, London, 1608.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The second contemporary account appears in <i>Purchas His Pilgrimes</i>, iv. 1685-1690,
published in 1625, and is entitled, “Obseruations gathered out of a Discourse of the
Plantations of the Southerne Colonie in Virginia by the English, 1606, written by that
Honorable Gentleman Master George Percy.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The narrative gives in minute detail the
incidents of the first voyage and of the movements of the colonists after their arrival at
Cape Henry until their landing, on the 14th of May, at Jamestown. It is to be regretted
that a meagre abridgment only of so valuable a narrative should have been preserved by
Purchas, who assigns as a reason for the omissions he made in it, that “the rest is
more fully set down in Cap. Smith’s Relations.”</p>

<p>The third account of the period, “Newport’s Discoveries in Virginia,” was published
for the first time in 1860 in <i>Archæologia Americana</i>, iv. 40-65. It consists of three
papers, the most extended of which is entitled: “A Relatyon of the Discovery of our
river from James Forte into the Maine; made by Captain Christopher Newport, and sincerely
written and observed by a Gentleman of the Colony.” This “Relatyon” is principally
confined to an account of the voyage from Jamestown up the river to the “Falls,”
at which Richmond is now situated, and back again to Jamestown, beginning May 21 and
ending June 21, the day before Newport sailed for England. The second paper, of four
pages, is entitled: “The Description of the new-discovered river and country of Virginia,
with the liklyhood of ensuing riches, by England’s ayd and industry.” The remaining
paper, of only a little more than two pages, is: “A brief description of the People.”
These papers were printed from copies made under the direction of the Hon. George
Bancroft, LL.D., from the originals in the English State Paper Office, and were edited by
the Rev. Edward Everett Hale.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The next account to be noted, “A Discourse of Virginia,” by Edward Maria Wingfield,
the first President of the colony, was also printed for the first time in <i>Archæologia
Americana</i>, iv. 67-163, from a copy of the original manuscript in the Lambeth Library,
edited by Charles Deane, LL.D., who also printed it separately. The narrative begins
with the sailing of Newport for England, June 22, 1607, and ends May 21, 1608, on
the author’s arrival in England. The final six pages are devoted by Wingfield to
a defence of himself from charges of unfaithfulness in duty, on which he had been
deposed from the Presidency and excluded from the Council. The narrative was cited
for the first time by Purchas in the margin of the second edition of his <i>Pilgrimage</i>, 1614,
pp. 757-768. He also refers to what is probably another writing, “M. Wingfield’s notes,”
in the margin of p. 1706, of vol. iv. of his <i>Pilgrimes</i>. Mr. Deane reasonably conjectures
that the narrative of Wingfield as originally written was more comprehensive, and that a
portion of it has been lost.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Chapter I. of Neill’s <i>English Colonization in America</i> is
devoted to Wingfield.</p>

<p>Another narrative of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A Relation of Virginia</i>, written by Henry Spelman, “the third son of the Antiquary,”
who came to the colony in 1609, was privately printed in 1872 at London for James Frothingham
Hunnewell, Esq., of Charlestown, Mass., from the original manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Spelman,
who was a boy when he first came to Virginia, lived for some time with the Indians,
became afterwards an interpreter for the Colony, and was killed by the savages in 1622
or 1623.</p>

<p>In 1609 there were four tracts printed in London, illustrative of the progress of the
new colony:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Saules Prohibition staid, a reproof to those that traduce Virginia.</i></p>

<p>2. William Symondes’ <i>Sermon</i> before the London Company, April 25, 1609.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>A Good Speed to Virginia.</i> The dedicator is R. G., who “neither in person nor
purse” is able to be a “partaker in the business.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>In 1610, appeared the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. W. Crashaw’s <i>Sermon</i> before Lord Delaware on his leaving for Virginia, Feb. 21,
1609.</p>

<p>2. <i>A true and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the plantation begun in
Virginia.</i><a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>4. The mishaps of the first voyage and the wreck at Bermuda were celebrated in a little
poem by R. Rich, one of the Company, called <i>Newes from Virginia</i>, which was printed in
London in 1610.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>William Strachey was not an actual observer of events in the colony earlier than
May 23, 1610, when he first reached Jamestown. The incidents of his letter, July 15,
1610, giving an account of the wreck at Bermuda and
subsequent events <i>(Purchas</i>, iv. 1734), must, so far as
antecedent Virginia events go, have been derived from
others.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

with the Manners and Customes of the People</i>,&mdash;one
preserved
in the

among the

and the
other is among the Ashmolean MSS. at Oxford. They vary in no important respect.
The former was the copy used by R. H. Major in editing it for the Hakluyt Society in
1849. This copy was dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon.</p>

<p>In 1612 the little quarto volume commonly referred to as the <i>Oxford Tract</i> was printed,
with the following title: <i>A Map of Virginia. With a Description of the Country, the
Commodities, People, Government, and Religion, Written by Captaine Smith, sometimes
Governour of the Country. Whereunto is annexed the proceedings of those Colonies
since their first departure from England, with the discoveries, Orations, and relations
of the Salvages, and the accidents that befell them in all their Iournies and discoveries.
Taken faithfully as they were written out of the writings of Doctor Rvssell, Tho.
Stvdley, Anas Todkill, Ieffra Abot, Richard Wiffin, Will. Phettiplace, Nathaniel
Powell, Richard Potts. And the relations of divers other intelligent observers there
present then, and now many of them in England, by W. S. At Oxford, Printed by
Joseph Barnes</i>, 1612. As the title indicates, the tract consists of two parts. The first,
written as Smith says, in the <i>Generall Historie</i>, “with his owne hand,” is a topographical
description of the country, embracing climate, soil, and productions, with a full account
of the native inhabitants, and has only occasional reference to the proceedings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
colony at Jamestown. The second part of the <i>Oxford Tract</i> has a separate titlepage as
follows: “The proceedings of the English Colonie in Virginia since their first beginning
from England in the year 1606, till this present 1612, with all their accidents that befell them
in their iournies and Discoveries. Also the Salvages’ discourses, orations, and relations of
the Bordering Neighbours, and how they became subject to the English. Vnfolding even the

<p>Alexander Whitaker’s <i>Good Newes from Virginia</i> was printed in 1613. He was minister
of Henrico Parish, and had been in the country two years. The preface is by
W. Crawshawe, the divine.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Ralph Hamor the younger, “late secretary of that colony,”
printed in London in 1615 his <i>True Discourse of the present state of Virginia</i>, bringing
the story down to June 18, 1614. It contains an account of the christening of Pocahontas
and her marriage to Rolfe. It was reprinted in 1860 at Albany (200 copies) for Charles
Gorham Barney, of Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Rolfe’s <i>Relation of Virginia</i>, a MS. now in the British
Museum, was abbreviated in the 1617 edition of Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimage</i>, and printed at length
in the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>, 1839, and in the <i>Virginia Historical Register</i>, i. 102.
(See also Neill’s <i>Virginia Company</i>, ch. vi.) There are various other early printed tracts,
besides those already mentioned, reprinted by Force, which are necessary to a careful
study of Virginian history.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately a copy of the records of the Company<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624,
is preserved. This copy was made from the originals, which are not now known to exist,
at a time when the King gave sign of annulling their charter. Nicholas Ferrar (see the
<i>Memoir of Nicholas Ferrar</i> by Peter Peckard, London, 1790, a volume throwing much
light on early Virginian history, and compare Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, i. 192), with the
aid of Collingwood the secretary, seems to have procured the transcription at the house of
Sir John Danvers, in Chelsea, an old mansion associated with Sir Thomas More’s memory.
Collingwood compared each folio, signed it,&mdash;the work being completed only three days before
judgment was pronounced against the Company,&mdash;and gave the whole into the hands
of the Earl of Southampton for safe keeping, from whom the records passed to his son
Thomas, Lord High Treasurer, after whose death, in 1667, William Byrd, of Virginia, bought
them for sixty guineas, and it was from the Byrd family, at Westover, that Stith obtained
them, to make use of in his <i>History</i>. By some means Stith’s brother-in-law, Peyton Randolph,
got them, and at his death in 1775 his library was sold, when Jefferson bought it,
and found these records among the books. Jefferson’s library afterwards becoming the
property of the United States, these records in two volumes (pp. 354 and 387 respectively)
passed into the Library of Congress, where they now are.</p>

<p>In May, 1868, Mr. Neill, who had used these records while working on his <i>Terra
Mariæ</i>, memorialized Congress, explaining their value, and offering, without compensation,
to edit the MS., under the direction of the Librarian of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The question of
their publication had already been raised by Mr. J. Wingate Thornton ten years earlier,
in a paper in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, February, 1858, p. 33, and in a pamphlet, <i>The First
Records of Anglo-American Colonization</i>, Boston, 1859. In these the history of their
transmission varies a little from the one given above, which follows Neill’s statements.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
Being thwarted in his original purpose, Mr. Neill made the records the basis of a <i>History
of the Virginia Company of London</i>, Albany, 1869, which, somewhat changed, appeared
in an English edition as <i>English Colonization in America in the Seventeenth Century</i>.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Of considerable importance among the papers transmitted to our time is the collection
which had in large part belonged to Chalmers, and been used by him in his <i>Political
Annals</i>; when passing to Colonel William Aspinwall,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> they were by him printed in the
<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i> 4th series, vols. ix. and x., with numerous notes, particularly concerning
the earlier ones, beginning in 1617, in which the careers of Gates, Pory,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and Argall

<p>Mr. Deane, <i>True Relation</i>, p. 14, quotes as in Mr. Bancroft’s hands a copy from a
paper in the English State-Paper Office entitled “A Briefe Declaration of the Plantation
of Virginia during the first twelve years when S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Smyth was Governer of the
Companie [1606-1619], and downe to the present tyme [1624], by the Ancient Planters
now remaining alive in Virginia.” Mr. Noël Sainsbury, in his <i>Calendar of State Papers,
Colonial Series</i>, London, 1860, etc., has opened new stores of early Virginian as well
as of general Anglo-American history, between 1574 and 1660. The work of the Public
Record Office has been well supplemented by the <i>Reports of the Historical Commission</i>,
which has examined the stores of historical documents contained in private depositaries
in Great Britain. Their third Report of 1872 and the appendix of their eighth Report are
particularly rich in Virginian early history, covering documents belonging to the Duke
of Manchester. The <i>Index</i> to the Catalogue of MSS. in the British Museum discloses
others.</p>

<p>In 1860 the State of Virginia sent Colonel Angus W. McDonald to London to search
for papers and maps elucidating the question of the Virginia bounds with Maryland, Tennessee,
and North Carolina, which resulted in the accumulation of much documentary
material, and a report to the Governor in March, 1861, Document 39 (1861), which was
printed. See <i>Hist. Mag.</i> ix. 13.</p>

<p>Matter of historical interest will be found in other of the documents of this boundary
contest: Document 40, Jan. 9, 1860; Senate Document, Report of Commissioners, Jan.
17, 1872, with eleven maps, including Smith’s; Final Report, 1874; Senate Document No.
21, being reprints in 1874 of Reports of Jan. 9, 1860, and March 9, 1861; House Document
No. 6, Communication of the Governor, Jan. 9, 1877. There were also publications
by the State of Maryland relating to the contest.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>In 1874 there was published, as a State Senate Document, <i>Colonial Records of Virginia</i>,
quarto, which contains the proceedings of the first Assembly, convened in 1619 at
Jamestown,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> with other early papers, and an Introduction and Notes by the late Hon.
Thomas H. Wynne. Attention was first called in America to these proceedings by Conway
Robinson, Esq. (who had inspected the original manuscript in the State-Paper
Office, London), in a Report made as chairman of its Executive Committee, at an annual
meeting of the Virginia Historical Society, held at Richmond, Dec. 15, 1853, and published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in the <i>Virginia Historical Reporter</i>, i. 7. They were first published in the
<i>Collections</i> of the New York Historical Society, 1857, with an Introduction by George
Bancroft.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Abstracts from the English State-Paper Office have been furnished the State Library
of Virginia by W. Noël Sainsbury, to Dec. 30, 1730.</p>

<p>There are various papers on the <i>personnel</i> of the colony in the lists of passengers for
Virginia of 1635, which Mr. H. G. Somerby printed in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i> ii. 111, 211, 268; iii. 184, 388; iv. 61, 189, 261; v. 61, 343; and xv. 142; and in the
collection of such documents, mostly before published, which are conveniently grouped
in Hotten’s <i>Original Lists</i> (1600-1700), London, 1874 and 1881; and in S. G. Drake’s
<i>Researches among the British Archives</i>, 1860.</p>

<p>The Virginia Company published three lists of the venturers and emigrants in 1619,
and in 1620 a similar enumeration in a <i>Declaration of the State of the Colonie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> This was
dated June 24; another brief <i>Declaration</i> bears date Sept. 20, 1620. A list of ships
arriving in Jamestown 1607-1624 is given by Neill in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
1876, p. 415.</p>

<p>Neill has published various studies of the census of 1624 in the <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i> for 1877, pp. 147, 265, 393.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The most trustworthy source of information as to those who became permanent planters
and founders of families is afforded by the Virginia records of land patents, which
are continuous from 1620, and are no less valuable for topographical than for genealogical
reference.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The manuscript materials of the history of Virginia have been ever subject to casualty
in the varied dangerous and destructive forms of removal, fire, and war. The first capital,
Jamestown, was several times the scene of violence and conflagration. The colonial
archives were exposed to accident when the seat of government was removed to Williamsburg;
and finally when, in 1779, the latter was abandoned for the growing town of
Richmond, and when, upon the apprehended advance of the British forces during the
Revolution, they were again disturbed and removed hastily to the last place. It is probable
that at the destruction by fire of the buildings of William and Mary College, in 1705,
many valuable manuscripts were lost which had been left in them when the royal
governors ceased to hold sessions of the Council within her walls, and when other government
functionaries no longer performed their duties there. Many doubtless suffered
the consequences of Arnold’s invasion in 1781, upon whose approach the contents of the
public offices at Richmond were hastily tumbled into wagons and hurried off to distant
counties. The crowning and fell period of universal destruction to archives and private
papers was, however, that of our late unhappy war, when seats of justice, sanctuaries,
and private dwellings alike were subjected to fire and pillage. The most serious loss
sustained was at the burning of the State Court House at Richmond, incidental on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
evacuation fire of April 3, 1865, when were consumed almost the entire records of the
old General Court from the year 1619 or thereabout, together with those of many of
the county courts (which had been brought thither to guard against the accidents of the
war) and the greater part of the records of the State Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Of the records of the General Court, a fragment of a volume covering the period April
4, 1670-March 16, 1676, is in the <i>Collections</i> of the Virginia Historical Society, and
another fragment&mdash;Feb. 21, 1678-October, 1692&mdash;is in the archives of Henrico County
Court at Richmond. In the State Library are preserved the journals of the General
Assembly from 1697 to 1744, with occasional interruptions.</p>

<p>Of the records of the several counties, the great majority of those of an early period,
it is certain, have been destroyed. Information as to the preservation of the following has
been received by the writer: Northampton (old Accomac), continuous from 1634;
Northumberland, from 1652; Lancaster, from 1652; Surrey, a volume beginning in
1652; Rappahannock, from 1656; Essex, from 1692; Charles City, a single volume,
from Jan. 4, 1650, to Feb. 3, 1655, inclusive; Henrico, a deed book, 1697-1704, and, with
interruptions, the same records to 1774,&mdash;all classes of records, unbroken, from October,
1781.</p>

<p>In elucidation of the social life and commerce of the period,&mdash;the three decades of the
seventeenth century,&mdash;the following may be named: Letters of Colonel William Fitzhugh,
of Stafford County, a lawyer and planter, May 15, 1679-April 29, 1699; Letters of Colonel
William Byrd, of the “Falls,” James River, planter and Receiver-General of the colony,
January, 1683-Aug. 3, 1691,&mdash;in the <i>Collections</i> of the Virginia Historical Society.</p>

<p>The following parish records preserved in the library of the Theological Seminary
near Alexandria, Va., are valuable sources of early genealogical information; Registers
of Charles River Parish, York County,&mdash;births 1648-1800, deaths 1665-1787;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Vestry
Books (some with partial registers) of Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, 1663-1767;
Petsoe Parish, Gloucester County, from June 14, 1677; Kingston Parish, Matthews
County, from 1679; St. Peter’s Parish, New Kent County, from 1686.</p>

<p>Of such of the early papers in the State archives at Richmond as escaped the casualties
of the war, the Commonwealth intrusted the editing to William P. Palmer; and vol. i.,
covering 1652-1781 (with a very few, however, before 1689), was published in 1875 as
<i>Calendar of State Papers and other Manuscripts preserved in the Capitol at Richmond</i>.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>On the life of Captain John Smith in general, some notes are made in another chapter
of this volume.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> It will be remembered that Fuller&mdash;in the earliest printed biography
of Smith, contained in his <i>Worthies of England</i>&mdash;says of him, “It soundeth much to
the diminution of his deeds, that he alone is the herald to publish and proclaim them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Deane first pointed out (1860), in a note to his edition of Wingfield’s <i>Discourse</i>,
that the story of Pocahontas’s saving Smith’s life from the infuriated Powhatan, which
Smith interpolates in his <i>Generall Historie</i>, was at variance with Smith’s earlier recitals
in the tracts of which that book was composed when they had been issued contemporaneous
with the events of which he was treating some years earlier, and that the inference
was that Smith’s natural propensity for embellishment, as well as a desire to feed the
interest which had been incited in Pocahontas when she visited England, was the real
source of the story. Mr. Deane still farther enlarged upon this view in a note to his edition
(p. 38) of Smith’s <i>Relation</i> in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It has an important bearing on the question that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Hamor, who says so much of Pocahontas, makes no allusion to such a striking service.
The substantial correctness of Smith’s later story is contended for by W. Robertson in the
<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, October, 1860; by William Wirt Henry, in <i>Potter’s American Monthly</i>, 1875;
and a general protest is vaguely rendered by Stevens in his <i>Historical Collections</i>, p. 102.</p>

<p>The file of the <i>Richmond Dispatch</i> for 1877 contains various contributions on the
early governors of the colony of Virginia by E. D. Neill, William Wirt Henry, and R. A.
Brock, in which the claims of Smith’s narrative to consideration are discussed. Charles
Dudley Warner, in <i>A Study of the Life and Writings of John Smith</i>, 1881, treats
the subject humorously and with sceptical levity. Smith finds his latest champion, a
second time, in William Wirt Henry, in an address, <i>The Early Settlement at Jamestown,
with Particular Reference to the late Attacks upon Captain John Smith, Pocahontas,
and John Rolfe</i>, delivered before the annual meeting of the Virginia Historical Society,
held Feb. 24, 1882, and published with the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Society. Mr. Deane’s
views are, however, supported by Henry Adams (<i>North American Review</i>, January,
1867, and <i>Chapter of Erie, and other Essays</i>, p. 192) and by Henry Cabot Lodge (<i>English
Colonies in America</i>, p. 6). Mr. Bancroft allowed for a while the original story to
stand, with a bare reference to Mr. Deane’s note (<i>History of the United States</i>, 1864,
i. 132); but in his Centenary Edition (1879, vol. i. p. 102) he abandoned the former assertion,
without expressing judgment. The most recent recitals of the story of Pocahontas
under the color of these later investigations have been by Gay, in the <i>Popular History
of the United States</i>, i. 283, and by Charles D. Warner in his <i>Captain John Smith</i>,
before named,&mdash;the latter carefully going over all the evidence.</p>

<p>Alexander Brown has contributed several articles, published in the <i>Richmond Dispatch</i>
in April and May, 1882, in which he controverts the views of Mr. Henry, not
only as to the truth of the story of the rescue, but as to the general veracity of Smith
as a historian, taking a more absolute position in this respect than any previous writer
has done.</p>

<p>Pocahontas is thought to have died at Gravesend just as she was about re-embarking
for America, March 21, 1617; and the entry on the records of St. George’s Church in
that place&mdash;which speaks of a “lady Virginia born,” and has been supposed to refer to
her&mdash;puts her burial March 21. 1617.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>For the tracing of Pocahontas’s descendants through the Bollings,&mdash;Robert Bolling
having married Jane Rolfe, the daughter of Thomas Rolfe, the son of Powhatan’s daughter,&mdash;see
<i>The Descendants of Pocahontas</i>, by Wyndham Robertson, 1855, and Wynne’s
Historical Documents, vol. iv., entitled <i>A Memoir of a Portion of the Bolling Family</i>,
Richmond, 1868 (fifty copies printed), which contains photographs of portraits of the
Bollings.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an engraving of Pocahontas by Simon Pass, which perhaps belongs to, but
is seldom found in, Smith’s <i>Generall Historie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The original painting is said to have
belonged to Henry Rolfe, of Narford,&mdash;a brother of John, the husband of Pocahontas,&mdash;and
from him passed to Anthony Rolfe, of Tuttington, and from him again, probably
by a marriage, to the Elwes of Tuttington, and it is mentioned in a catalogue of a sale of
their effects in the last century. It has not since been traced.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Richard Randolph, of Virginia, is said to have procured from England two portraits,&mdash;one
of Rolfe, and the other of Pocahontas,&mdash;and they were hung in his house at Turkey
Island. After his death, in 1784, they are said to have been bought by Thomas Bolling,
of Cobbs, Va., and the inventory showing them is, or was, in the County Court of Henrico.
In 1830 they were in the possession of Dr. Thomas Robinson, of Petersburg, when he
wrote of the portrait of Pocahontas that “it is crumbling so rapidly that it may be considered
as having already passed out of existence.” A letter of the late H. B. Grigsby
to Mr. Charles Deane states that he had heard it was on panel let into the wainscot. In
1843, while still owned by Mr. Robinson, R. M. Sully made a copy of it, which seems
to have proved acceptable, as appears from the attestations printed in M’Kinney and
Hall’s <i>Indian Tribes of North America</i>, 1844, vol. iii., where at p. 64 is a reproduction
in colors of Sully’s painting. Mr. Grigsby says that the original was finally destroyed in
a contest which grew out of a dispute when the house was sold, whether the panel went
with it or could be reserved.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Of the massacre at Falling Creek, March 22, 1621-22, the Virginia Company printed,
in Edward Waterhouse’s <i>Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia</i>,
a contemporary account.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Mr. Neill has made the transaction the subject of special
consideration in the <i>Magazine of American History</i>, i. 222, and in his <i>Letter to N. G.
Taylor</i> in 1868, and has printed a considerable part of Waterhouse’s account in his <i>Virginia
Company</i>, p. 317 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>The massacre is also incidentally mentioned by the present writer in a paper, “Early
Iron Manufacture in Virginia, 1619-1776,” in the <i>Richmond Standard</i>, Feb. 8, 1879,
and by James M. Swank, in “Statistics of the Iron and Steel Production of the United
States,” compiled for the Tenth Census, which may also be referred to for information as
to that industry in the Colony of Virginia.</p>

<p>An examination of the story of Claiborne’s rebellion is made in the Maryland chapter
in the present volume.</p>

<p>Respecting Bacon’s rebellion, the fullest of the contemporary accounts is that of
T. M. on “The beginning, progress, and conclusion of Bacon’s Rebellion,” which is
printed in Force’s <i>Tracts</i>, vol. i. no. 8.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Equally important is a MS. “Narrative of the
Indian and Civil Wars in Virginia,” now somewhat defective, which was found among the
papers of Captain Nathaniel Burwell, and lent to the Massachusetts Historical Society and
printed carelessly in their <i>Collections</i> in 1814, vol. xi., and copied thence by Force in his
<i>Tracts</i>, vol. i. no. 11, in 1836. The MS. was again collated in 1866, and reprinted accurately
in the Society’s <i>Proceedings</i>, ix. 299, when the original was surrendered to the Virginia
Historical Society (<i>Proceedings</i>, ix. 244, 298; x. 135). Tyler, <i>American Literature</i>,
i. 80, assigns its authorship to one Cotton, of Aquia Creek, whose wife is said to be
the writer of “An Account of our late troubles in Virginia,” which was first printed in
the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i>, Sept. 12, 1804, and again in Force’s <i>Tracts</i>, vol. i. no. 9. The
popular spreading of the news in England of the downfall of the rebellion was helped by
a little tract, <i>Strange news from Virginia</i>, of which there is a copy in Harvard College
Library. There is in the British Museum Sir William Berkeley’s list of those executed
under that governor’s retaliatory measures, which has been printed in Force’s <i>Tracts</i>,
vol. i. no. 10.</p>

<p>Other original documents may be found in Hening’s <i>Statutes at Large</i>, vol. ii.; in
the appendix of Burk’s <i>Virginia</i>; and in the <i>Aspinwall Papers</i>, i. 162, 189, published in
the <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i> <i>An Historical Account of some Memorable Actions, particularly
in Virginia, etc.</i>, by “Sir Thomas Grantham, Knight” (London, 1716), was reprinted
in fac-simile with an Introduction by the present writer (Carlton McCarthy &amp; Co.,
Richmond, 1882).<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The fragment of the records of the General Court of Virginia, cited
as being in the Collections of the Virginia Historical Society, contains details of the
trial of the participants in the “rebellion” not included in Hening, and the abstracts
from the English State-Paper Office, furnished by Mr. Sainsbury to the State Library of
Virginia, give unpublished details. Extracts from the same source are in the library of the
present writer. There are various papers in the early volumes of the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>; see April,
1867, for a contemporary letter. Massachusetts Bay proclaimed the insurgents rebels.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The earliest <i>History of Virginia</i> after John Smith’s was an anonymous one published
in London in 1705, with De Bry’s pictures reduced by Gribelin. When it was translated
into French, and published two years later (1707) both at Amsterdam and Orleans (Paris),
the former issue assigned the authorship to D. S., which has been interpreted D. Stevens,
and so it remained in other editions, some only title editions, printed at Amsterdam in
1712, 1716, and 1718, though the later date may be doubtful. (Sabin, ii. 5112.) The true
author, a native of Virginia and a Colonial official, had meanwhile died there in 1716.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
This was Robert Beverley.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The book is concisely written, and is not without raciness
and crispness; but its merits are perhaps a little overestimated in Tyler’s <i>American Literature</i>,
ii. 264. His considerate judgment of the Indians is not, however, less striking
than praiseworthy. For the period following the Restoration he may be considered the
most useful, though he is not independent of a partisan sympathy.</p>

<p>Sir William Keith’s <i>History of Virginia</i> was undertaken, at the instance of the Society
for the Encouragement of Learning, as the beginning of a series of books on the English
plantations; but no others followed. It was published in 1738 with two maps,&mdash;one of
America, the other of Virginia,&mdash;and he depended almost entirely on Beverley, and brings
the story down to 1723.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Forty years after Beverley the early history of the colony was again
told, but only down to 1624, by the Rev. William Stith, then rector of Henrico Parish;
being, however, at the time of his death (1755), the president of William and Mary College.
He seems to have been discouraged from continuing his narrative because the
“generous and public-spirited” gentlemen of Virginia were unwilling to pay the increased
cost of putting into his Appendix the early documents which give a chief value to his
book to-day. He had the use of the Collingwood transcript of the records of the Virginia
Company. His book, <i>History of the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia</i>, was
published at Williamsburg in 1747, and there are variations in copies to puzzle the bibliographer.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
Stith’s diffuseness and lack of literary skill have not prevented his becoming a
high authority with later writers, notwithstanding that he implicitly trusts and even praises
the honesty of Smith.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The somewhat inexact <i>History of Virginia</i> by John Burk has some of the traits of
expansive utterance which might be expected of an expatriated Irishman who had been
implicated in political hazards, and who was yet to fall in a duel in 1808.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This book,
which was published in three volumes at Petersburg (1804-5), was dedicated to Jefferson.
A fourth volume, by Skelton Jones and Louis Hue Girardin, was added in 1816; but
as the edition was in large part destroyed by a fire, it is rarely found with the other
three.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Burk used the copy of the Virginia Company records which had belonged
to John Randolph, as well as some collections made by Hickman (which Randolph had
had made when it was his intention to write on Virginian history), and Colonel Byrd’s
Journal.</p>

<p>The name of Campbell is twice associated with the history of Virginia. J. W. Campbell
published in 1813 at Petersburg a meagre and unimportant <i>History of Virginia</i>, coming
down to 1781. The best known, however, is the work of Charles Campbell, his son, who
in 1847, at Richmond, published a well-written <i>Introduction to the History of Virginia</i>,
and in 1860, at Philadelphia, a completed <i>History of the Colony and Ancient Dominion
of Virginia</i>, coming down to 1783,&mdash;a book written before John Smith was called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
romancer. The book, however defective in arrangement and execution, is thought to
be the best general authority.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>The most comprehensive <i>History of Virginia</i> is that of Robert R. Howison, vol. i.
coming down to 1763, being published at Philadelphia in 1846, and vol. ii., ending in
1847, being published at Richmond the next year. He is a pleasing writer, but sacrifices
fact to rhetoric, though he makes an imposing display of references.</p>

<p>To these may be added, in passing, William H. Brockenbrough’s <i>Outline of History of
Virginia to 1754</i>; Martin’s <i>Gazetteer</i>, 1835, and Howe’s <i>Historical Collections of Virginia</i>,
printed in Charleston, 1856.</p>

<p class="p2">Respecting the religious history of the colony, besides the general historians, there
have been several special treatments. Mr. Neill has written upon the Puritan affinities in
<i>Hours at Home</i>, November, 1867, and on Thomas Harrison and the Virginia Puritans in his
<i>English Colonization</i>, where is also a chapter on the planting of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Patrick Copland’s sermon, <i>Virginia’s God be thanked</i>, was preached before the Company
in London, April 18, 1622; a copy of which is in Harvard College Library. Cf.
Mr. Neill’s <i>Memoir of Rev. Patrick Copland</i>, New York, 1871, p. 52, and his <i>English
Colonization</i>, p. 104.</p>

<p>Further, see Hawkes’s <i>Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of the United States</i>,
“Virginia,” 1836; Hening’s Statutes; <i>Papers relating to the History of the Church in
Virginia</i>, 1650-1770, by W. S. Perry, 1870; Hammond’s <i>Leah and Rachel</i>, 1656; Bishop
Meade’s <i>Old Churches, etc.</i>, 1855; “Notes on the Virginia Colonial Clergy” in the <i>Episcopal
Recorder</i>, and reprinted separately by E. D. Neill, 1877; Savage’s Winthrop’s <i>History
of New England</i>, and Anderson’s <i>Church of England in the Colonies</i>, 1856.</p>

<p>The writer has also in his possession the Records of the Monthly Meeting of Henrico
County, June 10, 1699-1797, which he designs to use in a history of the Society of
Friends in Virginia. He has also earlier isolated records, and a partial registry of births,
marriages, and deaths of those of the faith of the Society in Henrico and Hanover counties
in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>For an account of early manufactures in Virginia, see Bishop’s <i>History of American
Manufactures</i>, 1866. For a view of the early agriculture, see a paper by the present
writer on the <i>History of Tobacco in Virginia from its Settlement to 1790</i>; <i>Statistics,
Agriculture, and Commerce</i>, prepared for the Tenth Census; <i>History of Agriculture in
Virginia</i>, by N. F. Cabell, 1857; the <i>Farmers’ Register</i>, 1833-42; <i>Transactions of the
State Agricultural Society of Virginia</i>, 1855; and “Virginia Colonial Money and
Tobacco’s Part therein,” by W. L. Royall, in <i>Virginia Law Journal</i>, August, 1877.</p>

<p>For a view of slavery in the colony, see Bancroft, ch. v.; O’Callaghan’s <i>Voyages of
the Slavers</i>; Wilson’s <i>Rise and Fall of the Slave Power</i>; Cobb’s <i>Inquiry</i>; and the
works of Cabell, Fitzhugh, Fletcher, Hammond, Ross, Stringfellow, and general histories.</p>

<p>It is evident that no single author has yet given an adequate history of Virginia;
and while it is true that much precious material therefor has perished, it is believed that
the original record is yet not wanting for such a representation of the past of the State
as would be at once more intelligible as to the motives which occasioned events, and more
convincingly just in the recital of them.</p>

<h3><a name="c167" id="c167"></a>EDITORIAL NOTES.</h3>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Maps of Virginia or the Chesapeake.</span>&mdash;There
seem to have been visits of
the Spaniards to the Chesapeake at an early day
(1566-1573), and they may have made a temporary
settlement (1570) on the Rappahannock.
(Robert Greenhow in C. Robinson’s <i>Discoveries
in the West</i>, p. 487, basing on Barcia’s <i>Ensayo
Chronologico</i>; <i>Historical Magazine</i>, iii. 268, 318;
J. G. Shea in Beach’s <i>Indian Miscellany</i>.) In
the map which De Bry gave with the several
editions of Hariot in 1590, the bay appears as
“Chesepiooc Sinus;” but in the more general
maps, shortly after, the name Chesipooc, or
some form of it, is applied rather wildly to some
bay on the coast, as by Wytfliet’s in 1597, or
earlier still by Thomas Hood, 1592, where the
“B. de S. Maria” of the Spaniards, if intended
for the Chesapeake, is given an outline as vague
as the rest of the neighboring coast, where it
appears as shown in the sketch in chapter vi.
between the Figs. 1 and 2. It may be, as Stevens
contends (<i>Historical and Geographical
Notes</i>), that not before Smith were the entangling
Asian coast-lines thoroughly eliminated
from this region; but certainly there was no
wholly recognizable delineation of the bay till
Smith recorded the results of the explorations
which he describes in his <i>Generall Historie</i>,
chs. v. and vi. Smith indicates by crosses on
the affluents of the bay the limits of his own
observations. Strachey’s <i>Historie of Travaile</i>,
p. 42.</p>

<p>In Smith’s <i>Map of Virginia, with a Description
of the Country</i>, etc., Oxford, 1612, W. S., or
William Strachey, eked out the little tract with
an appendix of others’ contributions. Strachey
afterwards adopted a considerable part in his
<i>Historie of Travaile</i>. Mr. Deane, in his edition
of the <i>True Relation</i>, p. xxi, has given a full
account of this tract. Smith reprinted it in his
<i>Generall Historie</i> with some changes and additions
and small omissions. Purchas reprinted
it in his <i>Pilgrimes</i>, but not without changes and
omissions of small extent, and with some additions,
which he credits on the margin to Smith;
and he had earlier given an abstract of it in his
<i>Pilgrimage</i>. There is a copy of the original in
the Lenox Library. Tyler, <i>American Literature</i>,
i. 30, notices it.</p>

<p>The map accompanying this tract, engraved
by W. Hole, appeared in three impressions
(Stevens’s <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 1870, no. 1,903).
It was altered somewhat, and the words, “Page
41, Smith,” were put in the lower right-hand
corner, when it was next used in the <i>Generall
Historie</i>, 1624 and later; and in 1625 it was
again inserted at pp. 1836-37 of Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimes</i>,
vol. iv. De Bry next re-engraved it in
part xiii. of his <i>Great Voyages</i>, printed in German,
1627, and in Latin 1634; and in part xiv.
in German in 1630 (<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i.
370-71). It was also re-engraved for Gottfriedt’s
<i>Newe Welt</i>, published at Frankfort, and marked
“Erforshet und beschriben durch Capitain Iohan
Schmidt.” The compiler of this last book was
J. Ph. Abelin, who had been one of De Bry’s co-workers,
and he made this work in some sort
an abridgment of De Bry’s, use being made of
his plates, often inserting them in the text, the
book being first issued in 1631, and again in
1655. (Muller’s <i>Books on America</i>, 1872, no.
636, and (1877) no. 1,269.)</p>

<p>The map was next used in two English editions
of Hondy’s <i>Mercator</i>, “Englished by W.
S.” 1635, etc., but with some fanciful additions,
as Mr. Deane says (Bohn’s <i>Lowndes</i>, p. 1103).
The map of the coast in De Laet, 1633 and 1640,
was, it would seem, founded upon it for the
Chesapeake region; cf. also the map of Virginia
and Florida called “par Mercator,” of
date 1633, and the maps by Blaeu, of 1655 and
1696.</p>

<p>Once more Smith’s plot adorned, in 1671,
Ogilby’s large folio on <i>America</i>, p. 193, as it had
also found place in the prototype of Ogilby, the
Amsterdam Montanus of 1671 and 1673. In
these two books (1671-73) also appeared the
map “Virginiæ, partis australis et Floridæ, partis
orientalis, nova descriptio,” which shows the
coast from the Chesapeake down to the 30th
degree of north latitude.</p>

<p>Smith’s was finally substantially copied as
late as 1735, as the best available source, in
<i>A Short Account of the First Settlement of the
Provinces</i>, etc., London, 1735,&mdash;a contribution
to the literature of the boundary dispute, and
was doubtless the basis of the map in Keith’s
<i>Virginia</i> in 1738; but it finally gave place
to Fry and Jefferson’s map of the region in
1750.</p>

<p>A phototype fac-simile, reduced about one
quarter, of the earliest state of the original map
in the Harvard College copy of the Oxford tract
of 1612 is given herewith. A similar fac-simile,
full size, is given in Mr. Deane’s reprint of the
<i>True Relation</i>, though it was not published in
that tract. A lithographic fac-simile, full size,
but without the pictures in the upper corners,
is given in the Hakluyt Society’s edition of
Strachey, p. 23. Other reproductions will be
found in Scharf’s <i>Maryland</i>, i. 6, Scharf’s <i>Baltimore
City and County</i>, 1881, p. 38, and in Cassell’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
<i>United States</i>, p. 27. That in the Richmond
(1819) reprint of the <i>Generall Historie</i> is
well done, full size, on copper. This copperplate
was rescued in 1867 from the brazier’s
pot by the late Thomas H. Wynne, and at the
sale of his library in 1875 was purchased for
the State Library of Virginia.</p>

<p>Neill, in his <i>Virginia Company</i>, p. 191, mentions
“A mapp of Virginia, discovered to y<sup>e</sup>
Hills and its latt. from 35 deg. and ½ neer
Florida to 41 deg. bounds of New England.
Domina Virginia Ferrar collegit, 1651,” and identifies
this compiler of the map as a daughter of
John Ferrar. The map we suppose to be the one
engraved by Goddard. This map is associated
with a London publication of 1650, called <i>Virgo
triumphans, or Virginia richly and truly valued</i>,
which is usually ascribed to Edward Williams,
but is held nevertheless to be in substance
the work of John Ferrar of Geding. There
were two editions of this year (1650): <i>Brinley
Catalogue</i> no. 3,816; Quaritch, <i>General Catalogue</i>,
no. 12,535, held at £36 John Ferrar’s copy of
the first edition, with his notes, and the original
drawing of the map, inserted by Ferrar to make
up a deficiency in the first edition, of which he
complains. Quaritch prices a good copy without
such annotations at £25. The second edition
(1650) had additions, as shown in the title,
<i>Virginia, more especially the South part thereof,
second edition, with addition of the discovery of
silkworms, etc.</i> In this the same map appeared
engraved as above, and the Huth copy of it has
it in two states, one without, and the other with
an oval portrait of Sir Francis Drake. (<i>Huth
Catalogue</i>, v. 1594.) The Harvard College
copy lacks the map, which is described by Quaritch
(no. 12,536, who prices this edition at £32)
in a copy from the Bathurst Library, as a folding
sheet exhibiting New Albion as well as Virginia,
with the purpose of showing an easy northern
passage to the Pacific, the text representing the
Mississippi as dividing the two countries, and
flowing into the South Sea; see also <i>Menzies’
Catalogue</i>, no. 2,143, and the note in Major’s
edition of Strachey, p. 34, on a map published in
1651 in London. This second edition was the
one which Force followed in reprinting it in his
<i>Tracts</i>, vol. iii. no. 11. The <i>Huth Catalogue</i> notes
a third edition, <i>Virginia in America richly valued</i>,
1651. The map is given on a later page.</p>


<p><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">The Virginia Historical Society.</span>&mdash;From
1818 to 1828 the eleven volumes of the
<i>Evangelical and Literary Magazine</i>, edited at Richmond
by John Holt Rice, D.D., had contained
some papers on the early history of the State,
but no organized effort was made to work in this
direction before the Virginia Historical and
Philosophical Society was formed, in December,
1831, with Chief Justice Marshall as president,
and under its auspices a small volume of <i>Collections</i>
was issued in 1833; but from February,
1838, to 1847 the Society failed to be of any
influence. Meanwhile, from 1834 to 1864 the
<i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> afforded some
means for the local antiquaries and historical
students to communicate with one another and
the public.</p>

<p>In December, 1847, a revival of interest resulted
in a reorganization of the old Association
as the Virginia Historical Society, with the
Hon. William C. Rives as president. Promptly
ensuing, Maxwell’s <i>Virginia Historical Register</i>
was started as an organ of the Society, and was
published from 1848 to 1853,&mdash;six volumes.
The Society laid a plan of publishing the annals
of the State, and, as preliminary, intrusted to
Conway Robinson, Esq., the preparation of a
volume which was published in 1848 as <i>An Account
of the Discoveries in the West until 1529,
and of Voyages to and along the Atlantic Coast of
North America from 1520 to 1573</i>. This was
an admirable summary, and deserves wider
recognition than it has had. It subsequently
published, besides various addresses, <i>The Virginia
Historical Reporter</i>, 1854-1860, which contained
accounts of the Society’s meetings. The
Civil War interrupted its work, but in 1867 the
Society was again resuscitated, and it has been
under active management since. There is a
bibliography of its publications in the <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, xvii. 340. Its historical students have
contributed to the files of the <i>Richmond Standard</i>
since Sept. 7, 1878, much early reprinted and
later original matter relating to Virginia.</p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;Since this chapter was completed has appeared Mr. George W. Williams’s <i>Negro Race in

<p class="pc1 mid">NORUMBEGA AND ITS ENGLISH EXPLORERS.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE REV. BENJAMIN F. DE COSTA, D.D.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Formerly Editor of the Magazine of American History.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE story of Norumbega is invested with the charms of fable and romance.
The name is found in the map of Hieronimus da Verrazano
of 1529, as “Aranbega,” being restricted to a definite and apparently unimportant
locality. Suddenly, in 1539, Norumbega appears in the narrative
of the Dieppe Captain as a vast and opulent region, extending from
Cape Breton to the Cape of Florida. About three years later Allefonsce
described the “River of Norumbega,” now identified with the Penobscot, and
treated the capital of the country as an important market for the trade in
fur. Various maps of the period of Allefonsce confine the name of Norumbega
to a distinct spot; but Gastaldi’s map, published by Ramusio in 1556,&mdash;though
modelled after Verrazano’s, of which indeed it is substantially an
extract,&mdash;applies the name to the region lying between Cape Breton and
the Jersey coast. From this time until the seventeenth century Norumbega
was generally regarded as embracing all New England, and sometimes portions
of Canada, though occasionally the country was known by other names.
Still, in 1582, Lok seems to have thought that the Penobscot formed the
southern boundary of Norumbega, which he shows on his map<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> as an island;
while John Smith, in 1620, speaks of Norumbega as including New England
and the region as far south as Virginia. On the other hand Champlain, in
1605, treated Norumbega as lying within the present territory of Maine.
He searched for its capital on the banks of the Penobscot, and as late as
1669 Heylin was dreaming of the fair city of Norumbega.</p>

<p>Grotius, for a time at least, regarded the name as of Old Northern
origin, and connected with “Norbergia.” It was also fancied that a people
resembling the Mexicans once lived upon the banks of the Penobscot.
Those who have labored to find an Indian derivation for the name say
that it means “the place of a fine city.” At one time the houses of the
city were supposed to be very splendid, and to be supported upon pillars
of crystal and silver. Pearls were also reported as abundant, which at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
early period was no doubt the case. Charlevoix offers the unsupported
statement that Francis I. made Roberval “Lord of Norumbega.” Roberval
was certainly the patentee of the whole territory of Norumbega, though
Mark Lescarbot made merry over the matter, as he could find nothing to
indicate any town except a few miserable huts. It is reasonable to infer,
however, that at an early period an Indian town of some celebrity existed.
Like the ancient Hochelaga, which stood on the present site of Montreal
and was visited and described by Cartier, it eventually passed away. To-day,
but for Cartier, Hochelaga would have had quite as mythical a reputation
as Norumbega, which, however, still forms an appropriate theme
for critical inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The first Englishman whose name has been associated with any portion
of the region known as Norumbega was John Rut. This adventurer
reached Newfoundland during August, 1527, and afterwards, according to
Hakluyt’s report, sailed “towards Cape Breton and the coastes of Arembec;”
but Purchas, who was better informed, says nothing about any
southward voyage. One of the ships, the “Sampson,” was reported as
lost, while the other, the “Mary of Guilford,” returned to England. There
is nothing to prove that Rut even reached Cape Breton; much less is it
probable that he explored the coast southward, along Nova Scotia, which
was called “Arembec.”</p>

<p>The first Englishman certainly known to have reached any portion of
the region here treated as Norumbega was David Ingram, a wandering
sailor. During October, 1568, with about one hundred companions, he
was landed on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico by Captain John Hawkins,
who, on account of the scarcity of provisions, sailed away and left these
messmates behind. With two of his companions Ingram travelled afoot
along the Indian trails, passing through the territory of Massachusetts and
Maine to the St. John’s River, where he embarked in a French ship, the
“Gargarine,” commanded by Captain Champagne, and sailed for France.
The narrative of his journey is profusely embellished by his imagination,
it may be,&mdash;as is generally held; but that he accomplished the long march
has never been doubted. At that period the minds of explorers were dazzled
by dreams of rich and splendid cities in America, and Ingram simply
sought to meet the popular taste by his reference to houses with pillars of
crystal and silver.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> He also says that he saw the city of Norumbega, called
Bega, which was three fourths of a mile long and abounded with peltry.
There is no doubt of his having passed through some large Indian village,
and possibly his Bega may have been the Aranbega of Verrazano.</p>

<p>At the close of 1578 Sir Humphrey Gilbert made a voyage to North
America, but may not have visited Norumbega. The earliest mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of his expedition is that found in Dee’s <i>Diary</i>, under date of Aug. 5,
1578, where he says: “Mr. Raynolds, of Bridewell, tok his leave of me
as he passed towards Dartmouth to go with Sir Umfry Gilbert towards
Hochelaga.”<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The first known English expedition to Norumbega was made in a “little
ffrigate” by Simon Ferdinando, who was in the service of Walsingham.
Ferdinando sailed from Dartmouth in 1579, and was absent only three
months. The brief account does not state what part of Norumbega was
visited; but the circumstances point to the northern part, and presumably
to the Penobscot region of Maine. It would also appear that the voyage
was more or less of the nature of a reconnoissance.</p>

<p>The first Englishman known to have conducted an expedition to
Norumbega was John Walker, who, the year following the voyage of
Ferdinando, sailed to the river of Norumbega, in the service of Sir Humphrey
Gilbert. He reached the Penobscot, of which he gave a rough
description, finding the region rich in furs, as described by Allefonsce and
Ingram. He discovered a silver mine where modern enterprise is now
every year opening new veins of silver and gold. This voyage, like that of
his predecessor, proved a short one,&mdash;the return trip being made direct
to France, where the “hides” which he had secured were sold for forty
shillings apiece.</p>

<p>In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert took possession of Newfoundland; and
afterwards sailed for Norumbega, whither his “man” Walker had gone
three years before. In latitude 44° north, near Sable Island, he lost his
great ship, the “Admiral,” with most of his supplies; when, under stress
of the autumnal gales, the brave knight reluctantly abandoned the expedition
and shaped his course for home, sailing in a “little ffrigate,”&mdash;possibly
the “barck” of Ferdinando. Off the Azores, in the midst of a furious
storm, the frigate went down, carrying Sir Humphrey with her; just as,
shortly before, Parmenius&mdash;a learned Hungarian who had joined the enterprise
expressly to sing the praise of fair Norumbega in Latin verse&mdash;had
gone down in the “Admiral.”</p>

<p>In 1584, while Sir Humphrey Gilbert lay sleeping in his ocean grave,
Raleigh was active in Virginia, where the work of colonization was pushed
forward during a period of six years.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Meanwhile the services of Simon
Ferdinando as pilot were employed in this direction in the pay of Granville,
and Norumbega for a space was unsearched, so far as we know, by the exploring
English. There seems, however, ground for supposing that the
fisheries or trade in peltries may have allured an occasional trafficking vessel,
and contraband voyages may have been carried on without the knowledge
of the patentee, the furs being sold in France. The elder Hakluyt appears
to have had a very fair idea of the region, and he knew of the copper mines
off the eastern coast of Maine, at the Bay of Menan, which was laid down
on the map of Molyneux. Nevertheless, the only voyager that we can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
point to is Richard Strong, of Apsham, who, in 1593, sailed to Cape Breton,
and afterwards cruised some time “up and down the coast of Arembec to
the west and southwest of Cape Breton.” He doubtless searched for seal
in the waters of Maine, and made himself familiar with its shores. It is said
that he saw men, whom he “judged to be Christians,” sailing in boats to
the southwest of Cape Breton.</p>

<p>The opening of the seventeenth century witnessed a revival of English
colonial enterprise; and Sir Walter Raleigh, though busy with schemes for
privateering, nevertheless found time to think of Virginia, of which, both
north and south, he was now the patentee. Accordingly he sent out a
vessel to Virginia under Mace, evidently with reference to the lost colonists.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Upon the return of Mace, Sir Walter went to Weymouth to confer with
him, when, to his surprise, he learned that, without authority, another expedition
had visited that portion of his grant which was still often called
Norumbega. This was the expedition of Gosnold, who sailed from Falmouth,
March 26, 1602, in a small bark belonging to Dartmouth, and called
the “Concord.” The company numbered thirty-two persons, eleven of
whom intended to remain and plant a colony, apparently quite forgetful
of the fact that they were intruders and liable to be proceeded against by
the patentee. In this voyage Gosnold took the direct route, sailing between
the high and low latitudes, and making a saving of nearly a thousand
miles. In this respect he has been regarded as an innovator, though
probably Walker pursued the same course. If there is no earlier instance,
Verrazano, as we now know, in 1524 set navigators the example of the
direct course, thereby avoiding the West Indies and the Spaniards. It is
reasonable to suppose that Gosnold took the idea direct from Verrazano,
as he left Falmouth with the Florentine’s letter in his hand, referring
directly to it in his own letter to his father; while Brereton and Archer
made abundant use of it in their accounts of the voyage. On May 14
Gosnold sighted the coast of Maine near Casco Bay, calling the place
Northland; twelve leagues southwest of which he visited Savage Rock,
or Cape Neddock, where the Indians came out in a Basque shallop, and
with a piece of chalk drew for him sketches of the coast. Next Gosnold
sailed southward sixteen leagues to Boon Island, and thence, at three
o’clock in the afternoon, he steered out “into the sea,” holding his course
still southward until morning, when the “Concord” was embayed by a
“mighty headland.” Their last point of departure could not have been
nearer the “mighty headland,” which was Cape Cod, than indicated by
the sailing time. If the starting-point had been Cape Ann, they would
have sighted Cape Cod before sunset. Archer says, when at Savage
Rock, that they were short of their “purposed voyage.” They had, then,
a definite plan. Evidently they were sailing to the place, south of Cape
Cod, described in the letter of Verrazano. Gosnold may have seen this
island in the great Verrazano map described by Hakluyt. At all events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Cape Cod was rounded, and the expedition reached that island of the Elizabeth
group now known as Cuttyhunk, where, upon an islet in a small lake,
they spent three weeks in building a fortified house, which they roofed with
rushes. All this work they kept a secret from the Indians, while they intended,
according to the narrative, to establish a permanent abode. Indeed,
this appears to have been the particular region for which Sir Humphrey
was sailing in 1583, as we know by Hakluyt’s annotation on the margin of
his translation of Verrazano which Gosnold used.</p>

<p>From Cuttyhunk the members of the expedition made excursions to the
mainland, and they also loaded their vessel with sassafras and cedar. When,
however, the time fixed for the ship’s departure came, those who were to
remain as colonists fell to wrangling about the division of the supplies; and,
as signs of a “revolt” appeared, the prospects of a settlement began to
fade, if indeed the idea of permanence had ever been seriously entertained.
Soon “all was given over;” and June 17 the whole company abandoned
their beautiful isle, with the “house and little fort,” and set sail, desiring
nothing so much as the sight of their native land. Gliding past the gorgeous
cliffs of Gay Head, the demoralized company had no relish for the
scene, but sailed moodily on to No-Man’s Land, where they caught some
wild fowl and anchored for the night. The next day the “Concord,”
freighted we fear with discord, resumed the voyage, and took her tedious
course over the solitary sea.</p>

<p>Gosnold reached South Hampton on the 23d of July, having “not one
cake of bread” and only a “little vinegar left;” yet even here his troubles
did not end, for in the streets of Weymouth he soon encountered Sir
Walter Raleigh, who confiscated his cargo of sassafras and cedar boards, on
the ground that the voyage was made without his consent, and therefore
contraband. Gosnold nevertheless protected his own interests by ingratiating
himself with Raleigh, leaving the loss to fall the more heavily on his
associates. Thus was Raleigh made, upon the whole, well pleased with the
results of the voyage, and he resolved to send out both ships again. Speaking
with reference to the unsettled region covered by his patent, he says,
“I shall yet live to see it an Englishe nation.”</p>

<p>The year 1603 was signalized by the death of Elizabeth and the accession
of James, while at nearly the same time Raleigh’s public career came
to an end. Before the cloud settled upon his life, two expeditions were sent
out. The “Elizabeth” went to Virginia, under the command of Gilbert,
who lost his life there; while Martin Pring sailed with two small vessels for
New England. Pring commanded the “Speedwell,” and Edmund Jones,
his subordinate, was master of the “Discoverer.” This expedition had
express authority from Raleigh “to entermeddle and deale in that action.”
It was set on foot by Hakluyt and the chief merchants of Bristol. Leaving
England April 10, Pring sighted the islands of Maine on the 2d of June,
and, coasting southward, entered one of the rivers. He finally reached Savage
Rock, where he failed to find sassafras, the chief object of his voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and accordingly “bore into that great Gulfe which Captaine Gosnold overshot.”
This gulf was Massachusetts Bay, the northern side of which did
not answer his expectations; whereupon he crossed to the southern side,
and entered the harbor now called Plymouth, finding as much sassafras as
he desired, and he remained there for about six weeks. The harbor was
named Whitson, in honor of the Mayor of Bristol; and a neighboring
hill, probably Captain’s Hill, was called Mount Aldworth, after another
prominent Bristol merchant. On the shore the adventurers built a “small
baricado to keepe diligent watch and warde in” while the sassafras was
being gathered in the woods. They also planted seed to test the soil.
Hither the Indians came in great numbers, and “did eat Pease and Beans
with our men,” dancing also with great delight to the “homely musicke”
of a “Zitterne,” which a young man in the company could play. This
fellow was rewarded by the savages with tobacco and pipes, together with
“snake skinnes of sixe foote long.” These were used as belts, and formed
a large part of the savage attire, though upon their breasts they wore plates
of “brasse.”</p>

<p>By the end of July Pring had loaded the “Discoverer” with sassafras,
when Jones sailed in her for England, leaving Pring to complete the cargo
of the other ship. Soon the Indians became troublesome, and, armed with
their bows and arrows, surrounded the “baricado,” evidently intending to
make an attack; but when Pring’s mastiff, “greate Foole,” appeared, holding
a half-pike between his jaws, they were alarmed, and tried to turn their
action into a jest. Nevertheless, the day before Pring sailed for England,
they set the forest on fire “for a mile space.” On August 9 the “Elizabeth”
departed from Whitson Bay, and reached Kingsroad October 2.
Thus two years before Champlain explored Plymouth Harbor, naming it
Port of Cape St. Louis, ten years before the Dutch visited the place, calling
it Crane Bay, and seventeen years before the arrival of the Leyden Pilgrims,
Englishmen became familiar with the whole region, and loaded their
ships with fragrant products of the neighboring woods.</p>

<p class="p2">We next approach the period when the French came to seek homes on
the coasts of the ancient Norumbega, as, in 1604, De Monts and Champlain
established themselves at St. Croix,&mdash;the latter making a voyage to Mount
Desert, where he met the savages, who agreed to guide him to the Penobscot,
or Peimtegoüet, believed to be the river “which many pilots and
historians call Norembegue.” He ascended the stream to the vicinity of
the present Bangor, and met the “Lord” of Norumbega; but the silver-pillared
mansions and towers had disappeared. The next year he coasted
New England to Cape Malabar, but a full account of the French expeditions
is assigned to another volume of the present work.</p>

<p>The voyage of Waymouth, destined to have such an important bearing
upon the future of New England colonization, was begun and ended before
Champlain embarked upon his second expedition from St. Croix, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
English captain thus avoided a collision with the French. Waymouth
sailed from Dartmouth on Easter Sunday, May 15, 1605 evidently intending
to visit the regions south of Cape Cod described by Brereton and Verrazano.
Upon meeting contrary winds at his landfall in 41° 2´ north, being
of an irresolute temper, he bore away for the coast farther east; and on
June 18 he anchored on the north side of the island of Monhegan. He
was highly pleased with the prospect, and hoped that it would prove the
“most fortunate ever discovered.” The next day was Whitsunday, when
he entered the present Booth’s Bay, which he named Pentecost Harbor.
He afterwards explored the Kennebec, planting a cross at one of its upper
reaches; and, sailing for England June 16, he carried with him five of the
Kennebec natives, whom he had taken by stratagem and force.</p>

<p>In connection with Waymouth’s voyage we have the earliest indications
of English public worship, which evidently was conducted according to
the forms of the Church, in the cabin of the “Archangel,” the savages being
much impressed thereby.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The historian of Waymouth’s voyage declares
“a public good, and true zeal of promulgating God’s holy Church by planting
Christianity, to be the sole intent of the honorable setter forth of this
discovery.”</p>

         title="" />
</div>

<p>The narrative of Waymouth’s voyage was at once published, and attracted
the attention of Sir John Popham, chief-justice. It also greatly
encouraged Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who, in connection with Sir John, obtained
from King James two patents,&mdash;one
for the London and the other for
the Plymouth company; the latter including
that portion of ancient Norumbega
extending from 38° north to 45°
north, thus completely ignoring the
claims of the French. The patentees
were entitled to exercise all those powers
which belong to settled and well-ordered society, being authorized to coin
money, impose taxes and duties, and maintain a general government for
twenty-one years.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>This was accomplished
in 1606, when Sir Ferdinando
Gorges sent out a ship under Captain
Challons, which was captured by the
Spaniards and never reached her destination.
Before hearing of the loss
of this ship, another was despatched under Thomas Hanam, with Martin
Pring as master. Failing to find Challons, they made a very careful exploration
of the region, which Sir Ferdinando says was the best that ever
came into his hands. In the mean time the five Indians brought home by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Waymouth had been in training for use in connection with colonization
under the supervision of Gorges. Indeed he expressly says that these
Indians were the means, “under God, of putting on foot and giving life to
all our plantations.” Accordingly the plans of a permanent colony were
projected, and on the last day of May, 1607, two ships&mdash;the “Gift of God”
and the “Mary and John”&mdash;were despatched under the command of Captain
George Popham, brother of the chief-justice, and Captain Raleigh
Gilbert. At the end of twenty-one days the expedition reached the Azores,
where the “Mary and John,” having been left behind by her consort, barely
escaped from the Netherlanders. Finally, leaving the Azores, Gilbert stood
to sea, crossing the ocean alone, and sighted the hills of Le Have, Nova
Scotia, July 30. After visiting the harbor of Le Have, Gilbert sailed southward,
rounding Cape Sable, and entered the “great deep Bay” of Fundy.
Then he passed the Seal Islands, evidently being well acquainted with the
ground, and next shaped his course for the region of the Penobscot, looking
in the mean time for the Camden Hills, which, on the afternoon of August 5,
lifted their three double peaks above the bright summer sea. As he confidently
stood in towards the land, the Matinicus Islands soon shone white
“like unto Dover clifts;” and afterward the “Mary and John” found good
anchorage close under Monhegan, Waymouth’s fortunate island, named in
honor of England’s patron saint, St. George. Landing upon the island
Gilbert found a sightly cross, which had been set up by Waymouth or some
other navigator. The next morning, as the “Mary and John” was leaving
Monhegan, a sail appeared. It proved to be the “Gift of God,” of whose
voyage no account is now known. In company with his consort Gilbert
returned to the anchorage ground. At midnight he made a visit to Pemaquid,
on the mainland, accompanied by Skidwarres, one of Waymouth’s
Indians, rowing over the placid waters with measured stroke among many
“gallant islands.” They found the village sought for, and then returned.
The next day was Sunday, when the two ships’ companies landed upon
Monhegan,&mdash;then crowned with primeval forests and festooned with luxuriant
vines,&mdash;where their preacher, the Rev. Richard Seymour, delivered a
discourse and offered prayers of thanksgiving. The following is the entry
of the pilot:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Sondaye beinge the 9th of August, in the morninge the most part of our holl company
of both our shipes landed on this Illand, the wch we call St. George’s Illand,
whear the crosse standeth; and thear we heard a sermon delyvred unto us by our
preacher, gguinge God thanks for our happy metinge and saffe aryvall into the contry;
and so retorned abord aggain.”</p>

<p class="p1">This, so far as our present information extends, is the first recorded religious
service by any English or Protestant clergyman within the bounds of
New England, which was then consecrated to Christian civilization.</p>

<p>On Sunday, August 19, after encountering much danger, both ships
were safely moored in the harbor of Sagadahoc at the mouth of the Kennebec.
The adventurers then proceeded to build a pinnace called the
“Virginia,” the first vessel built in New England. She crossed the Atlantic
several times.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Kennebec was explored by Gilbert, while a fort, a
church, a storehouse, and some dwellings were built upon the peninsula of
Sabino, selected as the site of the colony. The two ships returned to England,
the “Mary and John” bearing a Latin epistle from Captain Popham
to King James. It gave a glowing description of the country, which was
even supposed to produce nutmegs. During the winter Popham died; and
in the spring, when a ship came out with supplies, the colonists were found
to be greatly discouraged, their storehouse having been destroyed by fire,
and the winter having proved extremely cold. Besides, no indications of
precious metals were found, and they now learned that the chief-justice,
like his brother, had passed away. Accordingly the fort, “mounting twelve
guns,” was abandoned, and Strachey says “this was the end of that northern
colony upon the river Sagadehoc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>After the abandonment of Sabino the English were actively engaged
in traffic upon the coast; as appears from the testimony of Captain John
Smith, who, in describing his visit to Monhegan in 1614, says that opposite
“in the Maine,” called Pemaquid, was a ship of Sir Francis Popham,
whose people had used the port for “many yeares” and had succeeded in
monopolizing the fur-trade. The particulars concerning these voyages, and
the scattered settlers around the famous peninsula of Pemaquid, are not
now accessible.</p>

<p>The next Englishman to be referred to is Henry Hudson, who, with a
crew composed of English and Dutch, visited Maine in 1609,&mdash;probably
finding a harbor at Mt. Desert, where he treated the Indians with cruelty
and fired upon them with cannon. Sailing thence he touched at Cape Cod,
and went to seek a passage to the Indies by the way of Hudson River, which
had been visited by Verrazano in 1524, and named by Gomez the following
year in honor of St. Anthony. The voyage of Hudson is not of necessity
connected with English enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The next year Captain Argall, from
Virginia, visited the Penobscot region for supplies, but he does not appear
to have communicated with any of his countrymen.</p>

<p>In 1611 the English showed themselves on the coast with a strong hand.
This fact is learned from a letter of the Jesuit Biard, who, in writing to his
superior at Rome, gives the history of an encounter between the English
and French. From his narrative it appears that early in 1611 a French
captain, named Plastrier, undertook to go to the Kennebec, and was made
a prisoner by two ships “that were in an isle called Emmetenic, eight leagues
from the said Kennebec.” He escaped by paying a ransom and agreeing
not to intrude any more. This fact coming to the knowledge of Biencourt,
the commander at Port Royal, the irate Frenchman proceeded to the Kennebec
to find the English and to obtain satisfaction from them. Upon
reaching the site of the Popham colony at Sabino, Biencourt found the
place deserted. On his return he visited Matinicus (Emmetenic), where he
saw the shallops of the English on the beach, but did not burn them, for the
reason that they belonged to peaceful civilians and not to soldiers. Who
then were the English for whom Biencourt was so considerate? Evidently
they were those led by Captains Harlow and Hobson, who, as stated by
Smith, sailed from Southampton for the purpose of discovering an isle
“supposed to be about Cape Cod.” They visited that cape and Martha’s
Vineyard, and, it would appear, sailed along the coast of Maine, where
they showed Plastrier their papers, indicating that they acted by authority.
Possibly, however, Sir Francis Popham’s agent, Captain Williams, may have
been the commander who expelled the French. At all events there was
no lack of English representation on the coast of New England in 1611.
Smith, speaking in a fit of discouragement, says that “for any plantation
there was no more speeches;” but the fact that Sir Francis annually for
many years sent ships to the coast indicates brisk enterprise, though there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
may have been no movement in favor of such a venture as that of the
colony of 1607. Many scattered settlers, no doubt, were living around
Pemaquid. Smith may be quoted again as saying that no Englishman was
then living on the coast; but this is something that he could not know. It
is also opposed to recognized facts, and to the declaration of Biard that the
English in Maine desired “to be masters.” Still we do not at present know
the name of a single Englishman living in New England during the winter
of 1611. In 1612 Captain Williams was opposite Monhegan, at Pemaquid,
where, no doubt, his agents lived all the year round, collecting furs. In
1613 the scene became more animated. At this period the French were
boldly inclined, and Madame de Guercheville had determined to found a
Jesuit mission in what was called Acadia. In 1613, therefore, the Jesuits
Biard and Masse left Port Royal and proceeded to establish themselves on
the border of Somes’s Sound in Mount Desert, where they began to land
their goods and build a fortification, the ship in which they came being
anchored near the shore. Argall, who was fishing in the neighborhood,
learned of their arrival from the Indians, and by a sharp and sudden attack
captured the French ship. He sent a part of the company to Nova
Scotia, and carried others to Virginia. This action was not justified by
the English Government, and some time afterward the French ship was
surrendered.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In the year 1614 Captain John Smith, the hero of Virginia, enters
upon the New England scene; yet his coming would appear, in some respects,
to have been without any very careful prevision, since he begins
his narrative by saying, “I chanced to arive in New England, a parte of
Ameryca, at the Ile of Monahiggan.” The object of his expedition was
either to take whales or to try for mines of gold; and, failing in these, “Fish
and Furres was our refuge.” In most respects the voyage was a failure, yet
it nevertheless afforded him the opportunity of writing his <i>Description of
New England</i>, whose coast he ranged in an open boat, from the Penobscot
to Cape Cod. His brief description, so fresh and unconventional, will
never lose its value and charm; and, because so unique, it will maintain a
place in the historical literature of its time. Smith knew that his impressions
were more or less crude, yet the salient features of the coast are well
presented. At the Penobscot he saw none of the people, as they had gone
inland for the summer to fish; and at Massachusetts, by which he meant
the territory around Boston, “the Paradise of all those parts,” he found the
French six weeks in advance of him, they being the first Europeans known
to have visited the place. The River of Massachusetts was reported by the
natives as extending “many daies Iourney into the entralles of that countrey.”
At Cohasset he was attacked by the natives, and was glad to escape;
while at Accomacke, which he named Plymouth, he found nothing lacking
but “an industrious people.” He was the third explorer to proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in print the value of the situation.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> One result of his examination was his
Map of New England, which he presented to Prince Charles.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>


<p>During the year 1614 another expedition was sent out. Gorges says
that while he was considering the best means of reviving his “languishing
hopes” of colonization, Captain Harlow brought to him one of the Indians
whom he had captured in 1611. This savage, named Epenow, had been
exhibited in London as a curiosity, being “a goodly man of brave aspect.”
Epenow was well acquainted with the New England tribes. At the same
time Sir Ferdinando had recovered Assacumet, one of Waymouth’s Indians,
who had been carried to Spain, in 1606, when Challons was captured by the
Spaniards. The possession of these two Indians inspired the knight with
hope, since he was firmly persuaded that in order to succeed in colonization
it would be necessary to have the good-will of the natives, whose co-operation
he hoped to secure through the good offices of those whom he
had taught to appreciate, in some measure, the advantages of English civilization.
In this respect he was wise. In connection therefore with the
Earl of Southampton he fitted out a ship, which was put in command of
Captain Hobson, whom he describes as “a grave gentleman.” Hobson
himself invested a hundred pounds in the enterprise, one of the main
objects of which was to discover mines of gold. This metal, Epenow said,
would be found at Capawicke, or Martha’s Vineyard. Hobson sailed in
June, 1614, and finally reached the place where Epenow was “to make
good his undertaking,” and where the savages came on board and were
entertained in a friendly and hospitable way. Among the guests were
Epenow’s brothers and cousins, who improved the occasion to arrange
for his escape,&mdash;it being decided, as it appears from what followed, that
upon their return he should jump overboard and swim away, while the
tribe menaced the English with arrows. They accordingly appeared in full
strength at the appointed time, when Epenow, though closely watched, and
clothed in flowing garments to render his retention the more certain, succeeded
in evading his keepers and jumped overboard. Hobson’s musketeers
immediately opened fire, foolishly endeavoring to shoot the swimming
savage, while Epenow’s friends bravely shot their arrows and wounded the
master of the ship and many of the crew. In the end Epenow escaped;
and Sir Ferdinando says: “Thus were my hopes of that particular mode
void and frustrate;” adding, that such are “the fruits to be looked for by
employing men more zealous of gain than fraught with experience how
to make it.” Hobson however did not lose so much as was supposed; for,
though no doubt Epenow believed that gold existed at Capawicke, and
that if it should prove necessary he could bring the English to the mine, it
is clear that no precious metal existed. The supposed gold was simply a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sulphate of iron, which the mineralogist finds to-day in the aluminous clays
of Gay Head.</p>

<p>Though both Smith and Hobson had failed essentially in the objects of
their voyage, the former was not in the slightest degree disheartened, but
spoke in such glowing terms of the country and its resources that the
Plymouth Company resolved to take vigorous action, and offered Smith
“the managing of their authority in those parts” for life. The London
Company was also stirred up, and sent out four ships before the people of
Plymouth acted. The Londoners offered Smith the command of their
ships, which he declined, having already made a life-engagement. Nevertheless
the London ships sailed in January, led by Captain Michael Cooper,
and reached Monhegan in March, where they fished until June, and then
sent a ship of three hundred tons to Spain loaded with fish. This ship was
taken by the Turks, while another sailed to Virginia, leaving the third to
return to England with fish and oil. Smith’s Plymouth friends, however,
furnished only two ships. Nevertheless he sailed with these, Captain Dermer
being second in command. His customary ill fortune still attended
him, and not far from port he lost both his masts, while his consort went
on to New England. Sailing a second time in a small vessel of sixty tons,
Smith was next captured by French pirates; and, while tossing at sea in
captivity, wrote his <i>Description of New England</i>. His language has been
regarded as very significant where he speaks of “the dead patent of this
unregarded country;” but this is the language of a depressed prisoner.
The patent was not dead; while, if it had been dead, English enterprise was
alive, of which his own voyage, though cut short by pirates, was a convincing
proof. To show that the patent was not dead, the Plymouth Company,
in 1615, sent out Sir Richard Hawkins, who was acting “as President for
that year.” Hawkins sailed October 15. Gorges says that he spent his
time while in New England very usefully in studying the products of the
country; but unfortunately he arrived at the period when the Indian war
was at its height, and many of the principal natives were killed. From
New England he coasted to Virginia, and thence he sailed to Spain, “to
make the best of such commodities as he had got together,” which Sir
Ferdinando loosely says “was all that was done by any of us that year.”
Nevertheless, Smith tells us that Plymouth in 1616 sent out four ships, and
London two; while Purchas states that “eight voluntarie ships” went to
New England to make “further tryall.” Another of two hundred tons, the
“Nachen,” commanded by Edwarde Brawnde, who addressed an account
of the voyage to “his worthye good frend Captayne John Smith, admirall of
New England,” also went out. In his letter reference is made to other vessels
on the coast. The “Nachen,” of London, sailed from Dartmouth March
8, and reached Monhegan April 20. Afterwards Brawnde went to Cape Cod
in his pinnace to search for pearls, which were also the first things sought for
by the Leyden emigrants, in 1620, when they reached the harbor of Provincetown.
Brawnde also mentions that he had his boats detained by Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Richard Hawkins, who thus appears to have wintered upon the coast and
to have sailed to Virginia in the spring. Notwithstanding various mishaps,
Brawnde entertained a favorable impression of New England, where profitable
voyages were to be made in fish and furs, if not spoiled by too many
factors, while he found the climate good, and the savages “a gentell-natured
people,” altogether friendly to the English.</p>

<p>In 1617 Smith himself made the discovery that the patent of New England
was not dead. At that time he had secured three ships, while his life-appointment
for the new country was reaffirmed. Still misfortune continued
to pursue him, and he did not even succeed in leaving port. Together with
a hundred sail he was wind-bound at Plymouth for three months. By the
terms of the contract he says that he was to be admiral for life, and “in
the renewing of their Letters pattents so to be nominated.” But for the
unfortunate head-winds he would have gone to New England in 1617 and
undertaken a permanent work, as the times were ripe. He might have begun
either at Plymouth or Massachusetts, “the paradise of all those parts,”
and thus have made Boston anything but a Nonconformist town.</p>

<p>In 1618 the English were still active, and Captain Rocroft went to Monhegan
to meet Captain Dermer, who was expected from Newfoundland.
Dermer, however, failed to appear, while Rocroft improved the occasion to
seize “a small barque of Dieppe,” which he carried to Virginia. This
Frenchman was engaged in the fur-trade at Saco, in disregard of the claims
of the English; but Gorges, with his customary humanity, condoned the
offence, the man “being of our religion,” and kindly made good his loss.
Soon after capturing the French trader, Rocroft came near being the victim
of a conspiracy on the part of certain of his own men. When the plot was
discovered he spared their lives, but set them ashore at Saco, whence they
went to Monhegan and passed the winter, but succeeded in escaping to
England in the spring. About this time that poorly known character, Sir
Richard Vines, passed a winter on the coast, probably at Saco, sleeping in
the cabins of the Indians, and escaping the great plague, which swept away
so many of the Sagamores. The winter fisheries were commonly pursued,
and the presence of Englishmen on the coast all the year round was no
doubt a common thing, while a trading-post must have been maintained at
Pemaquid. Rocroft finally sailed to Virginia, where he wrecked his vessel,
and then lost his life in a brawl. Thus suddenly this “gallant soldier”
dropped out of New England history.</p>

<p>With the summer of 1619 Dermer finally reached Monhegan, the rendezvous
of English ships, and found that Rocroft had sailed for Virginia.
While his people engaged in fishing, he explored the coast in a pinnace as
far as Plymouth, having Squanto for his guide, and then travelled afoot
westward to Nummastuquyt, or Middleboro’. From this place he sent
a messenger to the border of Narragansett Bay, who brought “two kings”
to confer with him. Here also he redeemed a Frenchman who had been
wrecked at Cape Cod. Dermer adds immediately, that he obtained another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
at Mastachusit, or the region about Boston, which he must have visited on
his way back to Monhegan. The account of his exploration is meagre;
and he hints vaguely at a very important island found June 12, which may
have been thought gold-bearing, as he says that he sent home “some of
the earth.” Near by were two other islands, named “King James’s Isles,”
because from thence he had “the first motives to search for that now probable
passage which hereafter may be both honorable and profitable to his
Majesty.” Clearly he refers to a supposed passage leading through the
continent to the Pacific and the Indies. In a letter to Purchas, not now
known, he mentioned the important island first referred to, and probably
described its locality, though its identity is now left to conjecture. It may
have been situated near Boston Harbor, while the “probable passage” may
have been suggested by the mouths of the Mystic and the Charles, which,
according to the report given by the natives to Smith, penetrated many days’
journey into the country.</p>

<p>Dermer finally reached Monhegan, and sent his ship home to England.
He afterwards put his surplus supplies on board the “Sampson,” and despatched
her for Virginia. He then embarked once more in his pinnace
to range along the coast. Near Nahant, during a storm, his pinnace was
beached; but getting off with the loss of many stores, and leaving behind
his Indian guide, he sailed around Cape Cod. At a place south of the
cape he was taken prisoner by the natives, but he escaped covered with
wounds. Subsequently he sailed through Long Island Sound, and, passing
through Hell Gate, he found it a “dangerous cataract.” While here the
savages on the shore saluted him with a volley of arrows. In New York
Harbor the natives proved peaceable, and undertook to show him a strait
leading to the west; but, baffled by the wind, he sailed southward to Virginia,
where he made a map of the coast, which he would not “part with
for fear of danger.” This map probably exhibited his ideas respecting the
“westward passage,” which was to be concealed from the French and
Dutch.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> In Virginia this late but hopeful explorer of Norumbega died.</p>

<p>Dermer was emphatically an explorer, and even in 1619 was dreaming
of a route through New England to China; but his most important work
was the peace made with the Indians at Plymouth. It is mentioned in his
report to Gorges. This report was quoted in the <i>Relation</i> of the president
and council, and was used by Morton and Bradford. The latter quotes
him as saying, with reference to Plymouth, “I would that the first plantation
might here be seated, if there come to the number of fifty persons
or upward.” This was but the echo of Captain John Smith. Morton
endeavors, in an ungenerous spirit, to cheapen the services of Dermer,
but it would be as just to underrate the work of the English on the Maine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
coast; and we should remember that it was their faithful friend the Pemaquid
Chief Samoset who hailed the Leyden colonists, upon their arrival
at Plymouth, with the greeting, “Welcome, Englishmen!”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> This was simply
the natural result of the policy of peace and good-will which imparted
a gracious charm to the life of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who may be well
styled the Father of New England Colonization. Here we leave the English
explorers of Norumbega.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">DOCUMENTS, whether in our own tongue or in others, which throw light upon the
explorations of the English in Norumbega are by no means wanting. They embrace
formal report and epistolary chronicle in great variety and of considerable extent. In
some cases they are full and rich in details, but in others they disappoint us from their
meagreness. Such deficiency particularly confronts us when we are searching for the
tracks of their progress in maps or charts of these early dates.</p>

<p>The present writer has never found an Indian
on the coast of Maine who could recall the word
Norumbega, or any similar word. M. Beauvois
shows, among other facts, that the Icelandic
vaga is the genitive plural of <i>vagr</i>, signifying “a
bay.” Possibly, however, the word is Spanish.
In this language <i>b</i> and <i>v</i> are interchangeable;
and <i>vagas</i> often occurs on the maps, signifying
“fields;” while <i>norum</i> may be simply a
corruption of some familiar compound. Perhaps
the explanation of the word does not lie so far
away as some suppose, though the study of the
subject must be attended with great care. In
this connection may be consulted such works as
Ramusio’s <i>Navigationi et Viaggi</i>, etc., Venice,
1556, iii. 359; the <i>Ptolemy</i> of Pativino, Venice,
1596, p. 281; Wytfliet’s <i>Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ

<p>The voyage of John Rut has been pointed out as the earliest voyage having a possible
connection with any portion of the territory of Norumbega, which never included Bacalaos,
though Bacalaos, an old name of Newfoundland, sometimes included New England.
The extreme northeastern extension of Norumbega was Cape Breton. It was towards
Cape Breton and the coasts of Arembec, that Rut is said to have sailed when he left St.
John. Hakluyt is the first authority summoned in connection with a subject which has
elicited much curious discussion; but Hakluyt was poorly informed.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> He refers to the
chronicles of Hall and Grafton, who said that Henry VIII. sent out two ships, May
20, 1527; yet he did not know either the name of the commander or of the ships,
one of which was given as the “Dominus vobiscum.” Purchas, however, gives the
names of both ships, and the letter of Captain Rut to Henry VIII., together with a
letter in Latin, written by Albert de Prato, a canon of St. Paul’s, London, which is
addressed to Cardinal Wolsey.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Hakluyt, in his edition of 1589, reads, “towards the
coasts of Norombega,” instead of Arembec, as in the edition of 1600. The latter
appears to be a correction intended to limit the meaning. Arembec may have been
a name given to Nova Scotia. A similar name was certainly given to one or more islands
near the site of Louisburg.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> According to Hakluyt, Rut often landed his men “to search
the state of those unknown regions,” after he left the northerly part of Newfoundland;
but the confused account does not prove that it was on Cape Breton or Arembec that they
landed. Rut says nothing about any such excursion, but simply says that he should go
north in search of his consort, the “Samson,” and then sail with all diligence “to that
island we are commanded;” and Hakluyt says that it was an expedition intended to sail
toward the North Pole. Nevertheless, it has been fancied that Rut, in the “Mary of Guilford,”
explored all Norumbega, and then went to the West Indies. This notion is based
upon the statement of Herrera, who tells of an English ship which lost her consort in a storm,
and in 1519 came to Porto Rico from Newfoundland,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> the pilot, who was a native of Piedmont,
having been killed by the Indians on the Atlantic coast.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Herrera’s date has been
regarded as wrong; and it has been corrected, on the authority of Oviedo, and put at 1527.
There is no proof that Rut lost his pilot; but as he had with him a learned mathematician,
Albert de Prato, a priest, it has been assumed that the priest was both a pilot and an Italian,
and consequently that the vessel seen at Porto Rico was Rut’s. It would be more reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to suppose that this was the missing “Samson,” or else one of the English traders
sent to the West Indies in 1526/7.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The ship described by Herrera was a “great ship,”
heavily armed and full of stores. On the other hand, the “Mary of Guilford” was a small
vessel of one hundred and sixty tons only, prepared for fishing.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Finally, Rut was still at
St. John August 10, while Hakluyt states that the “Mary of Guilford” reached England
by the beginning of October. This, if correct, renders the exploration of Norumbega and
the cruise in the West Indies an impossibility. Nevertheless Rut must have accomplished
something, while it is significant that when Cartier explored the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in
1534, he found a cape called Cape Prato, apparently a reminiscence of the canon of St.
Paul’s.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>David Ingram’s narrative, referred to in the text, was printed by Hakluyt in 1589,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> who,
however, omitted it in 1600. Ingram suffered much, and saw many things, no doubt, with a
diseased brain. He listened also to the stories of others, repeating them with additions in
sailor fashion; and, besides, may have been moved by vanity. Purchas, referring to Hakluyt,
says, “It seemeth some incredibilities of his report caused him to leave him out in the
next Impression, the reward of lying being not to be believed in truths.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>The larger portion however, of the statements in his narrative appears to be true. He
seems to have occupied about eleven months in reaching a river which he calls Gugida,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> this
being simply the Indian Ouigoudi of Lescarbot,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and the Ouygoudy of Champlain,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> who,
June 24, 1604, explored the river, and named it the St. John.</p>

<p>Concerning Simon Ferdinando there has been much misapprehension. He was connected
with the Virginia voyages in 1584-86. In the latter year his ship was grounded.
This led to his being loaded with abuse by White.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> It was re-echoed by Williamson<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
and Hawks.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The latter declared that he was a Spaniard, hired by his nation to frustrate
the English colony, calling him a “treacherous villain” and a “contemptible mariner;”
yet Hawks did not understand the subject. Subsequently, Ferdinando’s real character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
came to light; and, in one of the oldest pieces of English composition produced on the
continent of North America, his skill and faithfulness were applauded by Ralph Lane.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
He was one of the numerous Portuguese domiciled in England; but he had powerful friends
like Walsingham, and thus became the leader of the first-known English expedition to
Norumbega. His life was somewhat eventful, and like most men of his class he occasionally
tried his hand at privateering. At one time he was in prison on a charge of heresy, and
was bailed out by William Herbert, the vice-admiral. His voyage of 1579 seems hitherto
to have escaped notice; but this, together with his personal history, would form the subject
of an interesting monograph.</p>

<p>It was through the calendars of the state-paper office that the fact of John Walker’s
voyage became known some time since, but not as yet with detail; and it is only by means
of a marginal note, which makes Walker “Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s man,” that we get any
clew to its purpose, and from which we are led to infer its tentative character, and its influence
upon Gilbert’s subsequent career.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Upon reaching Sir Humphrey Gilbert we discover a man rich in his intentions respecting
Norumbega. He was the patentee,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and he possessed power and resources which
would have insured success but for the untimely termination of his career. The true
story of his life yet remains to be written, and in competent hands it would prove a noble
theme.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The State Papers afford many documents throwing light upon his history, while
the pages of Hakluyt supply many facts.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The work of Barlow and others, from 1584 to 1590, does not properly belong to the
story of Norumbega; yet the attempts in Virginia may be studied for the side-lights which
they afford, the narratives being given by Hakluyt,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>&mdash;who also gives the voyage of the
“Marigold” under Strong, fixing the site of Arembec on the coast southwest of Cape
Breton.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>With the opening of the seventeenth century the literature of our subject becomes
richer. Gosnold’s voyage, now shorn of much of its former prestige, has only
recently come to be understood. It was somewhat fully chronicled by Brereton and
Archer, each of whom wrote accounts. The original volume of Brereton forms a
rare bibliographical treasure.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> It has been reprinted by the Massachusetts Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Society,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> but an edition properly edited is much needed. In 1625 Purchas gave Archer’s
account, with a letter by Brereton to Raleigh, and Gosnold’s letter to his father.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The voyage
is also treated in the Dutch collection of Van der Aa,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> which gives an engraving at
variance with the text, in that it represents the savages assisting Gosnold in building his
island fortification, the construction of which was in fact kept a secret. The voyage of
Gosnold has been accepted as an authorized attempt at colonization, and used to offset the
Popham expedition of 1607; but that part of the titlepage of Brereton which says that
the voyage was made by the permission of Raleigh is now known to be untrue, and the
contraband character of the enterprise stands confessed.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>It has been said more than once that Drake visited New England, and gave Gosnold
some account thereof; but while he brought home the Virginia adventurers in
1587, and may then have touched on the coast of North Virginia, no early account of
any such visit is found. It has also been said that Gosnold went so far in the work
of fortification as to build a platform for six guns. The authority for the statement does
not appear.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>The voyage of Martin Pring, as already pointed out, was a legitimate enterprise, having
the sanction of Sir Walter Raleigh, the patentee.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> This voyage is also the more noticeable
as having had the active support of Hakluyt. Harris says that a thousand pounds were
raised for the enterprise, and that Raleigh “made over to them all the Profits which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
arise from the Voyage.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Here, therefore, it may be proper to delay long enough to indicate
something of Hakluyt’s great work in connection with colonization.</p>

<p class="p2">Richard Hakluyt was born about the year 1553, and was educated at Westminster
School and Christ Church College, Oxford. At an early age he acquired a taste for history
and cosmography. In the preface to his work of 1589, dedicated to Walsingham, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I do remember that being a youth, and one of her Maiestie’s scholars at Westminster, that
fruitfull nurserie, it was my happe to visit the chamber of Mr. Richard Hakluyt my cosin, a
Gentleman of the Middle Temple, well known unto you, at a time when I found lying vpen his
boord certeine bookes of Cosmosgraphie with a vniversal Mappe: he seeing me somewhat curious
in the view thereof, began to instruct my ignorance by showeing me the divisions thereof.”</p>

<p class="p1">His cousin also turned to the 107th Psalm, relating to those who go down into the sea
in ships and occupy themselves on the great waters. Upon which Hakluyt continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The words of the Prophet, together with my cousin’s discourse (things of high and rare delight
to my young nature), tooke so deepe an impression that I constantly resolved, if euer I were
preferred to the Vniversity, where better time and more convenient place might be ministered for
these studies, I would by God’s assistance prosecute that knowledge and kinde of literature, the
doores whereof (after a sort) were so happily opened before me.”</p>

<p class="p1">This interview decided Hakluyt for life, and one of the first fruits of his zeal was his
<i>Divers Voyages</i>, published in 1582.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> In 1589 appeared his <i>Principal Navigations</i>.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> In
the year 1600 he enlarged his work, bringing it out in three volumes. In 1605 Hakluyt
was made a prebend of Westminster; and in 1609 he published <i>Virginia Richly Valued</i>,
being the translation of a Portuguese work.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Hakluyt also published other pieces. He
died in Herefordshire, in 1616, finding a burial-place in Westminster Abbey. Still
curiously enough, notwithstanding his great services to American colonization, his name
has never been applied to any portion of our country; though Hudson, in 1608, named a
headland on the coast of Greenland in his honor. He left behind, among other manuscripts,
one entitled <i>A Discourse of Planting</i>, recently published, though much of the
essence of the volume had been produced before in various forms.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Among the tracts
appended to Brereton are the <i>Inducements</i> of Hakluyt the Elder, who appears to have
known all about the <i>Discourse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In connection with the voyage of Waymouth, 1605, one topic of discussion relates to
the particular river which he explored. This, indeed, is a subject in connection with
which a divergence of opinion may be pardonable. Did he explore the St. George’s River,
or the Kennebec? Belknap, however, in 1796, in a crude fashion and with poor data,
held that the Penobscot was the river visited.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> In 1857 a Maine writer took the ground
that Waymouth explored the Kennebec.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Other writers followed with pleas for the St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

<p>Ballard wrote what was, in most respects, a convincing argument in support of
the Kennebec River.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> In opposition to the advocate of the Kennebec, it has been said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the high mountains seen by Waymouth were not the White Mountains,&mdash;for the reason
that the White Mountains could not be seen,&mdash;but were the Camden hills, towards which he
went from Monhegan; and consequently that he reached the St. George’s River, which lies
in that direction. It has been said, also, that the White Mountains cannot be seen from
that vicinity. This is simply an assumption. The White Mountains are distinctly visible
in fair weather from the deck of a ship lying inside of Monhegan.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Yet the mountains in
question have less to do with the subject than generally supposed, since a careful examination
of the obscure text shows that it is not necessary to understand Rosier as saying
that in going to the river they sailed directly towards the mountains. His language shows
that they “came along to the other islands more adjoining the main, and in the road directly
with the mountains.”<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Here it is not necessary to suppose that it was the course
sailed that was direct, but rather that it was the <i>road</i> that was direct with the mountains,&mdash;the
term <i>road</i> signifying a roadstead, or anchorage place at a distance from the shore, like
that of Monhegan. Beyond question Waymouth saw both the White and the Camden
mountains; but they do not form such an essential element in the discussion as both sides
have fancied. Strachey really settles the question where he says that Waymouth discovered
two rivers,&mdash;“that little one of Pamaquid,” and “the most excellent and beneficyall
river of Sachadehoc.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> This river at once became famous, and thither the Popham
colonists sailed in 1607. In fact, the St. George’s River was never talked about at that
period, being even at the present time hardly known in geography, while the importance of
the Kennebec is very generally understood.</p>

<p>The testimony of another early writer would alone prove sufficient to settle the question.
In fact, no question would ever have been raised if New England writers had been
acquainted with the works of Champlain at an earlier period. In July, 1605, Champlain
visited the Kennebec, where the natives informed him that an English ship had been on
the coast, and was then lying at Monhegan; and that the captain had killed five Indians
belonging to their river.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> These were the five Indians taken by Waymouth at Pentecost
Harbor&mdash;the modern Booth’s Bay&mdash;who were supposed to have been killed, though at
that time sailing on the voyage to England unharmed.</p>

<p>The narrative of the expedition of Waymouth was written by James Rosier, and published
in 1605.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It was printed by Purchas, with a few changes, in 1625;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> and reprinted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
by the Massachusetts Historical Society, in 1843.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> This narrative forms the source of
almost everything that is known about the voyage. It contains some perplexing passages;
but when properly interpreted, it is found that they are all consistent with other
statements, and prove that the river explored was the Kennebec.</p>

<p>The story of the Popham Colony, of 1607-8, at one time occasioned much acrimonious
discussion, for which there was no real occasion; but of late the better the subject has
been understood, the less reason has been found for any disagreement between the friends
of the Church of England and the apologists of New England nonconformity.</p>

<p>Prior to the year 1849 the Popham Colony was known only through notices found in
Purchas,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> the <i>Brief Relation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Smith,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Sir William Alexander, Gorges,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and others. In
the year 1849, however, the Hakluyt Society published Strachey’s work, entitled <i>The Historie
of Travaile into Virginia Britannia</i>, edited by R. H. Major; chapters viii., ix., and
x. of which contained an account of the Popham Colony found to be much fuller than any
that had appeared previously. In 1852 these chapters were reprinted with notes in the
<i>Collections</i> of the Massachusetts Historical Society;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and the next year four chapters of the
work were reprinted by the Maine Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> In 1863 the same society published
a <i>Memorial Volume</i>, which was followed by heated discussions, some of which, with a bibliography
of the subject, were published in 1866. Articles of a fugitive character continued
to appear; and, finally, in 1880, there came from the press the journal of the voyage to the
Kennebec in 1607, by one of the adventurers,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> which was reprinted in advance from the
<i>Proceedings</i> of the Massachusetts Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> It would seem from the internal
evidence furnished by the journal and the express testimony of Purchas,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> that this composition
was by James Davies, who, in the organization at the Sagadahoc, held the office of
Captain of the Fort. This journal was found to be the source whence Strachey drew
his account of the colony, large portions of which he copied verbatim, giving no credit.
Since the publication of this journal no new material has been brought to light.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The Popham Colony formed a part of the work undertaken by Sir Ferdinando Gorges
and his colaborers, who sought so long and so earnestly to accomplish the colonization of
New England.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Many experiments were required to insure final success, and the attempt
at Sagadahoc proved eminently useful, contributing largely to that disciplinary experience
essential under such circumstances. Viewed in its necessary and logical connection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it need not be regarded as a useless failure, since it opened the eyes of adventurers more
fully, bringing a clearer apprehension of the general situation and the special requirements
of the work which the North Virginia Company had in hand.</p>

<p>A paragraph that may have some bearing on the condition of things in Maine after the
year 1608 appeared in 1609, and runs as follows: “Two goodly Rivers are discovered
winding farre into the Maine, the one in the North part of the Land by our Westerne
Colonie, Knights and Gentlemen of <i>Excester</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>, and others. The other in the
South part thereof by our Colonie of <i>London</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Again a letter by Mason to Coke,
assigned to the year 1632, teaches that the work of colonization was considered as having
been continued from 1607.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> This would seem to indicate, that, in the opinion of the
writer, the work was not wholly abandoned; yet, concerning the actual condition of affairs
on the Maine coast for several years after the colonists left Fort Popham, much remains
to be learned. From neglected repositories in the seaport towns of the south of England,
material may yet be gleaned to show a continuous line of scattered residents living around
Pemaquid during all the years that followed the departure of the Popham colonists from
Sabino<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> in 1608.</p>

<p>The visit of Henry Hudson to New England in 1609 is described in Juet’s Journal.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Argall’s visit to New England in 1610 is treated by Purchas, though it has made no
figure in current histories.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> What appears to be the most correct account of the voyage of
Hobson and Harlow, in 1611, is found in Smith. The student may also consult the <i>Briefe
Relation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> which, however, appears to confuse the account by introducing an event of 1614,
the capture of Indians by Hunt. Gorges is also confused here, as in many other places.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
We are indebted to the French for the account of the capture and ransom of Plastrier.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>In connection with Argall’s descent upon the French at Mount Desert, it will be necessary
to consult the Jesuit Relations,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> which throw considerable light upon the transactions
of the English at this period; also the State Papers. These show that Argall’s ship was
named the “Treasurer.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Champlain says that this ship mounted fourteen guns, while
ten more English vessels were at hand.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> If his statement is correct, there must have been
a large number of Englishmen on the coast at this period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Smith, in 1614, as at other times, is his own historian, and his writings show the
growth of the feeling that existed with respect to colonization, and they at the same time
illustrate his adverse fortune.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Gorges makes us acquainted with Sir Richard Hawkins, who was on the New England
coast at the close of the year 1615. Sir Richard was the son of the famous John
Hawkins, who set David Ingram and his companions ashore in the Bay of Mexico. Hawkins
was born in 1555, and in 1582 he conducted an expedition to the West Indies. In
1588 he is found in command of the “Swallow,” and he distinguished himself in the
defeat of the Armada. He next sailed upon an expedition to the Pacific, where he was
captured and carried to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> In 1620 he was named in connection with the Algerine
expedition, dying at the end of 1621 or the beginning of 1622. A full account of his transactions
in New England would be very interesting; but the account of Gorges, in connection
with Brawnde’s Letter to Smith, must suffice.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>The story of Rocroft is told by Gorges, and Dermer writes of his own voyage at full
length.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It remains now to speak of the old cartology, so far as it may afford any traces of the
English explorers of Norumbega. At the outset the interesting fact may be indicated
that the earliest reference to Norumbega upon any map is that of the Italian Verrazano,
1529; while the most pronounced, if not the latest, mention during the seventeenth century
is that of the Italian Lucini, who engraved over his “Nova Anglia” the word “Norambega,”
which is executed with many flourishes.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Passing over the first cartographical indication of English exploration on the coast of
North America, in the map of Juan de la Cosa, which is figured and described in the
chapter on the Cabots; and passing over the French and the Italians,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>&mdash;adverting but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for a moment to the Dauphin map of 1543, with its novel transformation of the name
Norumbega into Anorobagea,&mdash;the next map that needs mention is that of John Rotz,
of 1542. It is of interest, for the reason that the “<i>booke of Idrography</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> of which it
forms a part, was dedicated by its author to Henry VIII. Rotz subscribes himself
“sarvant to the King’s mooste excellente Majeste.” The English royal arms are placed
at the beginning, though originally
Rotz intended to present
the book to Francis I. Indeed,
the outline of the coast is
drawn according to the French
idea. Nevertheless, the names
on the map are chiefly Spanish. It shows no English
exploration; and, in a general way, indicates an absence
of geographical knowledge on the part of that
nation, which, however, is recognized by the legend
placed in the sea opposite the coast between Newfoundland
and the Penobscot. The legend is as
follows: “The new fonde lande quhaz men goeth
a-fishing.” The main features of the coast are
delineated. Cape Breton and the Strait of Canseau, with the Penobscot and Sandy
Hook, are defined; but Cape Cod, the “Arecifes” of Rotz, appears only in name, though
in its proper relation to the Bay of St. John the Baptist, a name given to the mouth of
Long Island Sound, in connection with the Narragansett Waters. The word Norumbega
does not occur, and the nomenclature is hardly satisfactory. It contains no reference
either to Verrazano or Cartier. The so-called map of Cabot, 1544, does not touch the
particular subject under notice.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Frobisher’s map of 1578 shows a strait at the north leading from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, and bearing his name, but the map throws no light upon Norumbega.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>Dr. John Dee was much interested in American enterprise, and made a particular
study of the northern regions, as well as of the fisheries. Under date of July 6, 1578, he
speaks of “Mr. Hitchcok, who had travayled in the plat for fishing.”<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> A map bearing the
inscription, “Ioannes Dee, Anno, 1580,” is preserved in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> It reminds
one of Mercator’s map of 1569, but is not so full. Dee was frequently invited to the Court
of Elizabeth to make known her title to lands in the New World that had been visited by
the English; and he was deferred to by Hakluyt, Gilbert, Walsingham, and others.</p>

<p>He writes in his diary, under date of July 3, 1582, “A meridie hor 3½ cam Sir George
Peckham to me to know the tytle of Norombega, in respect of Spayn and Portugall parting
the whole world’s distilleryes; he promised me of his gift and of his patient ... of the
new conquest.”<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Gilbert’s voyage was then being projected, but Dee’s map has no
reference to him or the English adventurers.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> It shows the main divisions of the coast
of Norumbega, except Cape Cod, from Sandy Hook to Cape Breton. The Penobscot is
well defined, and Norombega lies around its headwaters.</p>

<p>The map in Hakluyt’s Edition of Peter Martyr, published 1587, shows the English
nomenclature around and north of the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but it gives
away the territory of Norumbega to the French as Nova Francia. On the west coast
of North America is Nova Albion. In Nova Francia there is a river apparently bearing
the name of Arambe, which, it has been suggested, was used later in a restricted sense.
Not far from this river, at the south, is the legend, “Virginia, 1580.”<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>A map made in 1592, by Thomas Hood, does not show any English influence on the
coast, but Norombega is represented north of the Penobscot, which is called R. des
Guamas, intended for “Gamas,” the Stag River.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The globe of Molyneux<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> shows the explorations of Davis in the north, and its author
calls the northern continent, north of Sandy Hook, “Carenas.” Confusion reigns to a considerable
extent. Norumbega is confined to the Penobscot, and nothing is indicated with
respect to the English in that quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The map of Molyneux, 1600, is extremely interesting, but it does not show the operations
of the English in New England, though the Bay of Menan is recognized, this being
the place so well known to Hakluyt the Elder for its deposits of copper.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
New England, as on Lok’s map, is shown as an island.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>The cartology at this period is very disappointing
though the maps pointed out the main features of the
coast. In many respects they were
inferior to some of the earlier
maps, and were occupied with a
vain iteration. A little later the
map of Lescarbot, of 1609, as
might be supposed, is
poor in its outlines and
devoted rather to the
French occupation.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Smith’s well-known
map, issued with his <i>Description
of New England</i>
in 1616, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
earliest to give a configuration of the coast, approaching accuracy; and he could have
found little in Lescarbot’s and Champlain’s maps to assimilate, even if he had known
them. Cape Cod now for the first time was drawn with its characteristic bend. Smith
says that he had brought with him five or six maps, neither true to each other nor to the
coast.</p>

<p>Smith’s map did not originally contain a single English name,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> but the young Prince
Charles, to whom it was submitted in accordance with Smith’s request, changed about
thirty “barbarous” Indian names for others, in order that “posterity” might be able to
say that that royal personage was their “godfather.” A number of Scotch names were
selected, among others, by the grandson of the Queen of Scots. Smith gave the name of
Nusket to Mount Desert, confusing it, perhaps, with the aboriginal Pemetic, which
was changed to Lomond, given as “Lowmonds” on the map. The prince very naturally
desired to give names recalling the country of his birth; and while Ben Lomond, one of
the noblest Caledonian hills, bears a certain grand resemblance to its namesake, the breezes
of the lake of Mount Desert, like “answering Lomond’s,”</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“Soothe many a chieftain’s sleep.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a similar spirit he named the Blue Hills of Milton the “Cheuyot hills;” the ancient
river of Sagadahoc being the Forth, with what was intended for “Edenborough” standing
near its headwaters. There is nothing on the map to recall the nonconformists of Nottinghamshire
and Lincolnshire, who afterwards came upon the coast, except Boston and Hull
which stand near the Isles of Shoals, being, in fancy, close together on the map, as afterwards
they were reproduced farther south, in fact.</p>

<p>The young prince, then a lad of about fifteen, no doubt had suggestions made to him
respecting the names to be selected, as he favored the southern and southwestern communities
like Bristol and Plymouth, which furnished those expeditions encouraged by
churchmen like Popham and Gilbert. Poynt Suttliff forms a distinct recognition of Dr.
Sutliffe, the Dean of Exeter, who took so much interest in New England.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>On this map we find the ancient Norumbega called New England. Rich says that Smith
was the first to apply this name. In reply, Mr. Henry C. Murphy has referred to its alleged
use by a Dutchman in 1612.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Special reference is made to a statement printed upon the
back of a map contained in a book brought out by Hessell Gerritsz at Amsterdam, giving
a description of the country of the Samoieds in Tartary. The phrase used, however, is
not “New England,” nor “Nova Anglia,” but “Nova Albion,”<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> which was applied to the
whole region by Sir Francis Drake, in his explorations on the Pacific coast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time
the continent lying between the Atlantic and the Pacific was regarded as a narrow strip of
land; and as late as 1651 it was estimated that it was only ten days’ journey on foot from
the headwaters of the James to the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In 1609 the country was called Nova
Britannia. It would seem, therefore, according to present indications, that Smith was
entitled to the credit given him by Rich. At all events the importance of Smith’s work in
New England cannot be questioned. Smith himself was not backward in asserting the
value of his services, declaring in one place that he “brought New England to the Subjection
of the Kingdom of Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> After the publication of his map, Norumbega
well-nigh disappeared from the pages of travellers,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and a new series of observation of the
territory was begun by the authors of works like those which chronicled the doings of the
Leyden Adventurers in New England.</p>

<h3><a name="c199" id="c199">EDITORIAL NOTES.</a></h3>


<p><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Earliest English publications on
America.</span>&mdash;The backwardness of the English
in all that related to the extension of American
discovery is distinctly apparent in the comparatively
few publications from the London press
in the sixteenth century which conduced to
spread intelligence of the New World on the
land and incite rivalry on the ocean. The following
list will show this:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>1509.</b> When Alexander Barclay put Sebastian
Brant’s <i>Ship of Fools</i> into English verse
and published it in folio in London, he disclosed
one of the earliest references to the Spanish discoveries
which the English people could have
read. This book is very rare; a copy brought
£120 at the Perkins sale in London in 1873,&mdash;<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, p. 245. This edition
has of late been reprinted in England, edited by
Jamieson.</p>

<p><b>1511.</b>(?) A book <i>Of the newe Lādes</i>, printed
about this time at Antwerp, but in English, is
thought to have been the earliest original treatise
in the English tongue which makes any
mention of America. The New World is supposed
to be meant by “Armenica.” Harrisse,
however, assigns 1522 as its date,&mdash;<i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i> p. 196. There is a copy in the British
Museum.</p>

<p><b>1519</b>, though put by some as early as 1510.
<i>A new Interlude of the iiij. Elements.</i> This has
been already described in Mr. Deane’s chapter.</p>

<p><b>1517.</b> Wynkyn de Worde printed Watson’s
English prose translation of Brant’s <i>Ship of
Fools</i>.</p>

<p>A half century and more slipped away without
the English press taking heed, except in
such chance notices as these, of what was so
closely engaging the attention of the rest of
Europe. But in</p>

<p><b>1553</b> appeared the earliest book produced in
England chiefly devoted to the American discoveries,
and this was Richard Eden’s <i>Treatyse of the
newe India</i>, which he had translated from the Latin
of the fifth book of Sebastian Munster’s <i>Cosmographia</i>,
pp. 1099 to 1113. See <i>Carter-Brown Cat.</i>
p. 171, and further in the chapter on the Cabots.</p>

<p>Munster was one of the most popular cosmographers
of his day. He had begun his work in
1532 by supplying a map by Apianus to Gyrnæus’s
<i>Novus Orbis</i> of that date, which was not very creditable,
being much behind the times; and he made
amends by trying to give the latest information
in an issue of Ptolemy, which he edited in 1540,
to which he supplied a woodcut map that did service
in a variety of publications for nearly all the
rest of the century. It was one of the earliest
maps, in which interstices were left in the block
for the insertion of type for the names, and in
this way it was made to accompany both German
and Latin texts. It was also used in Sylvanus’s
Ptolemy, the names being in red. Kohl, <i>Disc. of
Maine</i>, p. 296; <i>Harvard Coll. Lib. Bull.</i> i. 270.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Munster’s <i>Cosmographia</i>, to which he transferred
this map, was first published in German,
according to Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 258,
quoting the <i>Labanoff Catalogue</i>, in 1541, and
again in 1544, with a new map. After this there
were two German (1545 and 1550) and one Latin
(1550) edition, each published at Basle, and a
French edition (1552), all of which are generally
noted, besides Eden’s version of 1552 (owned by
Mr. Brevoort); cf. <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, 1865,
p. 27, and an earlier one (1543), cited in Poggendorff’s
<i>Biog.-lit. Handwörterbuch</i>, ii. 234, which
is not so generally recognized, if indeed it exists
at all. The statement is, however, enough to
indicate that Eden thus made a popular book
the medium of his first presentation to the English
public.</p>

<p><b>1555.</b> Richard Eden, who to his book-learning
added the results of converse with sailors,
next published his <i>Decades of the Newe Worlde,
or West India</i>, derived in large part, as shown
in Mr. Deane’s chapter, from the Latin of Peter
Martyr. This made to the English public the
first really collective presentation of the results
of the maritime enterprise of that time. (H.
Stevens, <i>Bibl. Hist.</i> 1870, no. 632; Field, <i>Indian
Bibliog.</i> no. 484; <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p. 184,
with fac-simile of title.) Among the
supplemental matters was a “Description
of the two Viages made out of
England into Guinea,” in 1553-54, which
were the earliest English voyages ever
printed. This 1555 edition, which fifty
years ago was worth in good copies six
guineas (Rich’s <i>Catalogue</i>, 1832, no. 30),
will now bring about £25. The Editor
has used the Harvard College and Mr.
Charles Deane’s copies. There was sold
in the Brinley sale, no. 40, the 1533 edition
of Peter Martyr, which was the copy
used by Eden in making this translation,
and it is enriched with his little marginal
maps and annotations. See Sabin’s
<i>Dictionary</i>, i. 201, where it is said
Bellero’s map, measuring 5 × 6½ inches,
is found in some copies. The Lenox
copy has a larger map, 10½ × 7 inches,
with a similar title.</p>

<p><b>1559.</b> “A perticular Description of
suche partes of America as are by travaile
founde out,” made the last chapter
of a heavy folio, <i>The Cosmographicalle
Glasse</i>, which appeared in London, the
work of a young man, William Cunningham,
twenty-eight years old, a doctor in
physics and astronomy. See <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, p. 214, where a fac-simile
of the author’s portrait as it
appeared in the book is given.</p>

<p><b>1563.</b> <i>The whole and true discouerie
of Terra Florida</i>, as set forth in English,
following Ribault’s narrative, was published
in London on the 30th of May.
The book is so scarce that the Lenox
and Carter-Brown Libraries have been
content with manuscript copies from the
volume in the British Museum. This
may possibly indicate that the destruction
of the edition followed upon much reading
and thumbing.</p>

<b>1568.</b> <i>The New found Worlde, or Antarctike<br />
... travailed and written in the French tong.<br />
by that excellent learned man, Master Andrewe
Thevet, and now newly translated into English.
Imprinted at London for Thomas Hacket.</i> This<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

untrustworthy book. See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,

</div></div>

<p><b>1576.</b> In April appeared Sir Humphrey
Gilbert’s <i>Discourse of a Discoverie for a new
passage to Cataia</i>, a Gothic-letter tract of great
rarity in these days. It is credited with giving a
new impulse to English explorations; and had
exerted some influence in manuscript copies
before being printed. See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
p. 258; <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 31, Heber’s
copy, which brought $255. It is also in the
Lenox Library; and this
and the Carter-Brown copy
have the rare map which in
the Catalogue of the latter
collection is given slightly
reduced, and it is in part
reproduced herewith. See
Fox Bourne’s <i>English Seamen</i>,
chs. 5 and 7. Gilbert
in this had undertaken to
prove, both from reasoning
and report, that there was
a northwest passage, and
that America was an island, and he recounts
traditions of its being sailed through. See Mr.
Deane’s chapter on “The Cabots.”</p>

<p><b>1577.</b> Settle published in London his <i>True
Reporte of the laste Voyage into the west and
northwest regions</i>, the author having accompanied
Frobisher on his voyage in 1577. Its rarity&mdash;for
besides the Grenville copy in the British
Museum, that in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p.
266, where its title is given in fac-simile, is the
only one we have noted&mdash;may signify the eagerness
there was to read it, with a consequent use
great enough to destroy the edition, though there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
are said to have been two issues the same year.
A fac-simile reprint (fifty copies) has been privately
made from the Carter-Brown copy; and it
is also reprinted in Brydges’s <i>Restituta</i>, 1814,
vol. ii. See <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1869,
p. 363,&mdash;a notice by John Russell Bartlett.</p>

<p><b>1577.</b> Richard Willes brought out in London,
with some augmentation, an edition of
Eden’s Peter Martyr, under the new title of <i>The
History of Trauvayle</i>, a stout volume, which in
the known copies has stood wear better.
Willes’s preface tells the story of Eden’s labors,
and adds, “Many of his Englysche woordes
cannot be excused in my opinion for smellyng
to much of the Latine.”</p>

<p>It would seem that the arrangement was still
mostly the labor of Eden, who did not die till
1576. Willes, however, suppressed Eden’s
preface of 1555.</p>

<p>This edition has likewise much appreciated
in value. Rich, in his 1832 <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 57,
priced a fine copy at £4 4<i>s.</i>; now one is worth
£20 or more. There
are copies in Harvard
College, Carter-Brown
(no. 312), Charles
Deane’s and Boston
Athenæum Libraries.

of the late voyage of discoverie for the
finding of a passage to Cathaya by the North-weast,
under the Conduct of Martin Frobisher, generall</i>.
This is also very rare. See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
no. 319, which shows the two rare maps, a
portion of one of which is given in fac-simile in
ch. iii. from that in Collinson’s <i>Martin Frobisher</i>.</p>

<p><b>1578.</b> Thomas Nicholas printed, under his
initials only, an English version of Gomara’s
account of Cortes’ conquest of New Spain,
called <i>The Pleasant Historie of the Conquest of the
Weast Indies</i>. Fine copies are worth about
£10. There are copies in the Boston Athenæum,
Lenox Library, etc. See <i>Carter-Brown

<p><b>1580.</b> A new edition of Frampton’s <i>Joyfull
Newes</i>. This edition is worth about £4. There
is a copy in Harvard College Library. Rich,
<i>Catalogue</i>, 1832, no. 64.</p>

<p><b>1580.</b> John Florio published a retranslation
into English from Ramusio’s Italian version of
Cartier’s <i>Voyage to New France</i> (1534), which
had appeared originally in French, but was not
now apparently accessible to Florio. <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, no. 331.</p>

<p><b>1581.</b> T. Nicholas published an English
translation, now very rare, of Zarate’s account
of the Conquest of Peru.</p>

<p><b>1582.</b> Hakluyt began his active participation
in furthering English maritime exploration
by his first publication, the little <i>Divers Voyages</i>,
dedicating it to Sir Philip Sidney; and in this he
says: “I marvaile not a little ... that we of
England could never have the grace to set fast
footing in such fertill and temperate places as
are left as yet unpossessed.” Again he says:
“In my public lectures I was the first that produced
and showed both the olde imperfectly
composed and the new lately reformed mappes,
globes, and spheares, to the generall contentment
of my auditory.” See further in Mr. Deane’s
chapter on “The Cabots.” Cf. W. C. Hazlitt’s
<i>Bibliog. Coll. and notes</i>, 1st ser. p. 101.</p>

<p>There is, unfortunately, no sufficiently extended
account of Hakluyt, and the most we
know of him must be derived from his own publications.
The brief account in Anthony Wood’s
<i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i> is the source of most of the
notices. Mr. J. Payne Collier has added something
in a paper on “Richard Hakluyt and
American Discovery” in the <i>Archæologia</i>, xxxiii.
383; and Mr. Winter Jones in his Introduction
to the reprint of the <i>Divers Voyages</i> has told
about all that can be gleaned, and in his Appendix
he gives some papers before unprinted,
including Hakluyt’s will. The subject has had
later treatment, with the advantage of some recent
information, in the Introduction to the <i>Westerne
Planting</i>, by Dr. Woods and Mr. Deane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of the criticism of John
Locke,&mdash;if he be the editor of Churchill’s <i>Collection</i>,&mdash;who
wished Hakluyt had condensed
more, and of Biddle, who accuses him of perversions
in his account of the Cabots (see Mr.
Deane’s chapter), the general opinion of
Hakluyt’s labor has been very high. Locke’s
explanatory catalogue of voyages, which appeared
in Churchill, is reprinted in Clarke’s
<i>Maritime Discovery</i>. Oldys in the <i>British Librarian</i>,
p. 136, analyzes Hakluyt’s books, and
there is a list of them in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i> and
in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p. 448. An
account of the set in the Lenox Library is
printed in Norton’s <i>Literary Gazette</i>, i. 384.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Divers Voyages</i>, perfect copies are
excessively rare, and the two maps are almost
always wanting. The two British Museum
copies have them, but the Bodleian has only the
Lok map, and the same is true of the Carter-Brown
copy (<i>Catalogue</i>, p. 290). The other
copies in America belong to Harvard College
(imperfect), Charles Deane, and Henry C. Murphy.
Of the maps, that by Lok is given in
reduced fac-simile in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>
(as also in chapter i. of the present volume),
and both are given full size in the reprint
of the Hakluyt Society.</p>

<p><b>1583.</b> Captain J. Carleill’s little <i>Discourse
upon the entended Voyage to the hethermoste Partes
of America</i>, a tract of a few leaves only, in
Gothic letter, was probably printed about this
time with the aim to induce emigration and the
fixing of commercial advantages. Hakluyt
thought it of enough importance to include it in
his third volume seventeen years later. <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, p. 292.</p>

<p><b>1583.</b> Sir George Peckham’s <i>True Report of
the late Discoveries</i>, etc. See further on this
tract on a preceding page.</p>

<p><b>1583.</b> M. M. S. published at London a small
tract giving a translation of Las Casas’ story
of the Spanish deeds in the New World. <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, p. 293.</p>

<p><b>1588.</b> What is called the second original
work published in England on the New World
is Hariot’s <i>New Foundland of Virginia</i>, a small
quarto of twenty-three leaves, imprinted at London.
Heber had a copy; and Brunet, the first to
describe it, took the title from Heber’s Catalogue.
There are copies in the Lenox, Huth (<i>Catalogue</i>,
ii. 652), Grenville (British Museum) and the
Bodleian libraries. Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>, viii. 30377,
who says this, adds that there was a copy sold
surprisingly low at Dublin in 1873, escaping the
attention of collectors. It was reprinted at
Frankfort in 1590. See chapter iv.</p>

<p><b>1588.</b> Appeared an English version of the
Latin account of Drake’s voyage.</p>

<p><b>1589.</b> Hakluyt gave out the first edition of
his <i>Principall Navigations</i>. Copies are at present
worth from £5 to £10, according to condition;
and we have noted the following: Harvard
College, Brinley (no. 33), Carter-Brown
(no. 384), Charles Deane, Long Island Historical
Society, Field (<i>Ind. Bibliog.</i> no. 631),
Crowninshield (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 487), etc. The
catalogues usually note the six suppressed leaves
of Drake’s voyage when present.</p>

<p>Hakluyt, at the end of his preface, speaks of
“The comming out of a very large and most
exact terestriall Globe, collected and reformed
according to the newest, secretest, and latest discoveries,
... composed by Mr. Emmerie Mollineaux,
of Lambeth, a rare gentleman in his
profession.”</p>

<p>In place of this Molineaux map, there sometimes
appears, at p. 597, what Hakluyt calls
“One of the best general mappes of the world,”
which is a recut plate of one in Ortelius’s Atlas;
and in other copies instead we find another
edition of the same, which is also found in the
English translation of Linschoten. Sabin says
he has sometimes found a woodcut of Gilbert’s
map substituted. The Ortelius map is reproduced
in chapter i. of the present volume.</p>

<p><b>1591.</b> Job Hortop’s <i>Rare Travales of an
Englishman</i>, published in London. Bohn’s
<i>Lowndes</i>, p. 1124. There is a copy in the British
Museum. Hortop was one of Ingram’s companions,
and after being captured and confined
in Mexico, reached England after very many
years’ absence.</p>

<p><b>1595.</b> John Davis published his <i>Worlde’s
Hydrographical Descriptions</i>, which in parts reiterates
the views of Gilbert’s <i>Discourse</i>. The only
copies known are in the Grenville Library (British
Museum) and Lenox Library, New York.
It is reprinted in the Hakluyt Society’s edition
of <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>, p. 191, and in the 1812
edition of Hakluyt’s <i>Principall Navigations</i>.</p>

<p><b>1596.</b> A third edition of Frampton’s <i>Joyfull
Newes</i>. A fine copy is worth about three guineas.
See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, no. 497.</p>

<p><b>1598.</b> Wolfe, of London, published an English
translation, by William Philip, of Linschoten’s
<i>Discours of Voyages into y<sup>e</sup> Easte and
West Indies, in foure Bookes</i>, with a dedication
to Sir Julius Cæsar,
Judge of the High
Court of Admiralty.
The preface adds:
“Which Booke being
commended by
Maister Richard
Hackluyt, a man that laboureth greatly to advance
our English Name and Nativity, the
Printer thought good to cause the same to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
bee translated into the English Tongue.” The
original became a very popular book on the
Continent. The maps of American interest are
those of the World, of the Antilles, and of South
America. The description of America begins
on p. 216. <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. no. 527;
<i>Crowninshield Catalogue</i>, no. 625; Rich (1832),

<p>These are all, or nearly all, the publications
brought out in English and relating to America
prior to the enlarged edition of Hakluyt’s Collection,
which was dedicated to Sir Robert Cecil,
and of which the third volume, bearing date
1600, was devoted to America. Compared with
the publications of the Continent for the same
century, they are strikingly fewer in number;
and such as they are, it will be seen that of the
thirty-four separate issues enumerated above
only fourteen
are of English
origin,
and of the
whole number
only
twelve belong
to the
first three quarters of the century.</p>

<p>During this same century the literature of
navigation took its origin. The Continental
nations had already preceded. It was not till
1528 that the first sea-manual appeared in England,
and no copy of it is now known. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was a translation of the French <i>Le Routier de la
Mer</i>, the antetype of the later rutters. The
English edition was called <i>The Rutter of the Sea</i>,
and other editions appeared in 1536, 1541, and
1560 (?); the second of these adding, “A
rutter of the northe, compyled by Rychard
Proude.” None of these, however, recognized
the American discoveries.</p>

<p>In 1561, Eden, at the suggestion of the Arctic
navigator, Stephen Burrough (b. 1525, d. 1586),
again tried to give some impulse to English interest
by his translation of Martin Cortes’ <i>Art
of Navigation</i>, which had appeared at Seville
ten years before. (<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, p.
151.) Cortes was the first to suggest a magnetic
pole. Frobisher, when he made his first voyage,
fifteen years later (1576), perhaps because
Eden’s translation was out of print, took with
him a Spanish edition of Medina’s <i>Arte de
Navegar</i>,&mdash;a work which preceded Cortes’, but
never became so popular in England.</p>

<p>In 1565 came a fifth edition of the <i>Rutter of
the Sea</i>, and in 1573 William Bourne first issued
his <i>Regiment of the Sea</i>, which long remained
the chief English book on navigation.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Eden put forth, at what precise date is not
known, but not later than 1576, <i>A very necessarie
and profitable book concerning Navigation, compiled
in Latin by Joannes Taisnierus</i>, in which
the translator intimates that Cabot knew more
of the ways of discovering longitude than he
had disclosed. See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
p. 262. <i>Davis’s Voyages</i> (Hakluyt Society) gives
the date 1579.</p>

<p>Such books, as the interest in America became
more general, increased rapidly, and I note
them in chronological order.</p>

<p><b>1577.</b> Second edition, <i>Regiments of the Sea</i>.</p>

<p><b>1578.</b> Edward Hellowes published in London,

<p><b>1584.</b> Fourth edition, Eden’s Cortes. See
<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 19, for a copy which has a
folding woodcut map of the New World, which
is usually wanting in later editions.</p>

<p><b>1589.</b> A sixth edition of Eden’s version of
Martin Cortes’ <i>Arte of Navigation</i> appeared.
Good copies of this small black-letter quarto
are worth about seven guineas. It is known that
Hakluyt about this time was endeavoring with
the aid of Drake to found in London a public
lecture for the purpose of advancing the art of
navigation.</p>

<p><b>1590.</b> Robert Norman translated from the
Dutch <i>The Safeguard of Saylers, or Great Rutter</i>.
Edward Wright corrected and enlarged this in
1612. Norman was the inventor of the dipping-needle,
in 1576.</p>

<p><b>1590.</b> Thomas Hood’s <i>Use of the Jacob’s
Staffe; also a dialogue touching the use of the

taking of latitude. The astrolabe, an instrument
of remote antiquity, had been adapted to sea-use
by Martin Behaim; but it was soon found that
it did not adapt itself to the automatic movement
of the observer’s body in a rolling sea, and
in 1514 the cross-staff was invented, or at least
was first described.</p>

<p><b>1592.</b> A third edition of Bourne’s <i>Regiment

of the Spaniards: “For what hath made the
Spaniard to be so great a Monarch, the Commander
of both Indies, to abound in wealth and
all Nature’s benefites, but only the painefull industrie
of his Subjects by Navigation.” No copy
of this first edition is known. The second edition,
1607, is in the British Museum, and from
this copy the tract is reprinted in <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>
(Hakluyt Society ed.).</p>

a popular instruction book.</p>

<p><b>1594.</b> Robert Hues printed in London a
Latin treatise on the Molineaux globes, <i>Tractatus

<p class="p2"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Hakluyt’s “Westerne Planting”
and the Maine Historical Society.</span>&mdash;The
history of this manuscript, so far as known, is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The family of Sir Peter Thomson (who died
in 1770) possessed it, from whom Lord Valentia
secured it, and this collector indorsed upon it
“unpublished” and “extremely curious.” It
subsequently is found in the hands of Mr. Henry
Stevens, who put it into a public sale in London,
May, 1854; and in the Catalogue (lot 474) it is
called “a most important unpublished manuscript,
63 pages, closely and neatly written, in the original
calf binding.” It brought £44, and passed
into the Collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps.
(Stevens’s <i>Hist. and Geog. Notes</i>, 1869, p. 20.)
This gentleman began in 1837 to print privately
a catalogue of his library, then kept at Middle
Hill, Worcestershire, and continued the printing,
sheet by sheet, and under no. 14097 this manuscript
appears as “A Hakluyt Discourse.” In
1859 Sir Thomas bought Thirlestane House,
Cheltenham, the seat of Lord Northwick, and
hither he removed his vast collections of manuscripts
and books, where they now are, in the
possession of his heirs, Sir Thomas having died
in 1872. They are open to inquirers under restrictions.
See <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
1873, p. 429.</p>

<p>The manuscript of the <i>Westerne Planting</i> is
not thought to be in Hakluyt’s hand, though
in a contemporary script; and the writing of it
by Hakluyt seems to have been in progress during
the summer of 1584, while its author was
thirty-two years old. There is evidence that it
existed in four or five copies,&mdash;of which the
only one known at this day is the Phillipps
copy,&mdash;one of which was for the queen, and
all were made with the view of recommending
the planting of Norumbega.</p>

<p>In 1867 Dr. Woods was commissioned by the
Governor of Maine to procure in Europe material
for the early history of the State, and the first
fruit was the engaging of Dr. Kohl in the work,
which subsequently assumed shape in his <i>Discovery
of Maine</i>, and the second the procurement
of this Hakluyt manuscript. Dr. Woods was
engaged in preparing it for the press, when his
health declined, and the labor was completed by
Mr. Charles Deane, the book being published by
the Maine Historical Society in 1877.</p>

<p class="p2">Under the auspices of this Society some important
historical work has been done. Dr.
Kohl’s book is the most elaborate summary yet
made of the early explorations on our New England
coast. The labors of Dr. Woods have been
the subject of consideration in Dr. E. A. Park’s
<i>Life and Character of Leonard Woods</i>, Andover,
1880, 52 pp., and in Dr. C. C. Everett’s notice in
<i>Me. Hist. Coll.</i>, viii. 481, and in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, xviii. 15. The late George Folsom opened
an important field of investigation in his <i>Catalogue
of Original Documents in the English Archives
relating to the Early History of Maine</i>, privately
printed, New York, 1858, which covers the years
1601-1700, and is said to have been compiled for
him by Mr. H. G. Somerby. See <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>,1859, p. 262, and 1869, p. 481. Of
the labors of William D. Williamson, the principal
historian of the State, there is due record in
the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xiii. 265, May, 1868, and
in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, i. 90. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Hon. William Willis, of whom there are accounts
in the <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>, vii. 473, and in the <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1873, p. 1, was for many
years the president of the Society, and besides
furnishing many communications, he issued a
bibliography of Maine in <i>Norton’s Literary Letter</i>,
no. 4, 1859, which was much enlarged in the
<i>Historical Magazine</i>, xvii. 145, March, 1870. In
connection with this
subject the bibliography
in Griffin’s <i>History
of the Press in
Maine</i>, 1872, deserves
notice. There is in
the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Jan.
1868, an account of
the Maine Historical
Society and the historical
investigations it
has patronized.</p>

          <p class="pf250">We are indebted for the photograph used by the engraver to Dr. Kohl’s successor in the librarianship of
the Public Library at Bremen, Dr. Heinrich Bulthaupt. No name ranks higher than Kohl’s in the investigations
of our early North American geography. “From my childhood,” he says, “I was highly interested in
geographical researches in connection with history.” Having gathered much material on the early cartographical
history of America in the archives and libraries of Europe, he came to this country, and receiving an appropriation
from Congress to enable him to make copies of his maps for the Government, he undertook that work, the
results of which are now in the State Department at Washington. All that he desired to do was not provided
for by the order of Congress, and he returned to Europe disappointed in his hopes, but leaving behind him,
besides the collections in Washington, a memoir with maps on the discovery of the western coast of America,
which is now in the library of the American Antiquarian Society. In Europe he annotated and published at
Munich in fac-simile the two oldest general maps of America, those known as Ribero’s and Ferdinando Columbus’s,
and a treatise on the history of the Gulf Stream, as well as a condensed popular history of the discovery of
America. In 1868 he undertook, what proved to be his chief contribution to American historical geography, his
<i>Discovery of Maine</i>. He did not feel that he had accomplished all in this that he would; but it still remains
the most important essay since Humboldt in that peculiar field. See Charles Deane’s notice of Kohl in <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Dec. 1878, and the memoir in the <i>Beilage zur Allgemeinen Zeitung</i>, Augsburg, July 9, 1879.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">The Popham
Colony.</span>&mdash;It was unfortunate,
as it was
unnecessary, that any
theological color
should have been given
to the discussion
arising out of the
claims made for this
colony, since the merits
of the case concerned solely the historical
significance of secular events, upon which all
were agreed in the main. The claim asserted by the
Maine Historical Society, or by those representing
it, was this: That the temporary settlement
at Sabino, being made under the charter
of 1606, was the first event to secure New England
for the English crown, and should therefore
be deemed the beginning of the existence
of its colonies. The claim of those historical
students who took issue was this: That the
granting in 1606 of a patent by the king to his
subjects concerned no further the question than
that it simply formulated a pre-existing claim,
while the actual attempts at colonization by Gosnold
in 1602, whether authorized or not,&mdash;the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
alternative having of late years been brought
forward by Dr. De Costa,&mdash;were more practically
demonstrative of that claim, in accordance
with the English interpretation of rights in new
countries, namely, actual possession. Further,
that the true historic beginning of New England
was not in the abortive attempts of Gosnold and
Popham to effect a settlement, however much, in
connection with many other events, they helped
in preparing a way, but in the permanent colonization
which was made at Plymouth in 1620,
which was the first founded upon family life,
and which under greater distress than befell
either of the others, was rendered permanent
more by the spirit of religious independency,
as evinced by their Holland exile, than by the
mercenary longing, which was professedly the
chief motive of the others. Strachey distinctly
says of the Popham Colony, that mining was
“the main intended benefit expected.”</p>

<p>It is susceptible of proof that the blood of the
Pilgrims and of their congeners runs through the
veins of a large part of the population of New
England to-day. No genealogical tree has been
produced which connects our present life with a
single one of the Sabino party. How, then, was
New England saved for the English race? The
decisive historical event is never those scattering
forerunners which always harbinger an epoch,
but the fulfilment of the idea which comes in the
ripeness of time.</p>

<p>The controversy as it was waged was a reaction
from the views with which the Pilgrims
had long been regarded for their devotion under
trial and for the pluck of their constancy in first
making English homes on this part of the continent.
Maine writers like George Folsom and
William Willis had never questioned such established
claims, but had reasserted them. The
leading spirit in this revocation of judgment was
Mr. John A. Poor, of Portland. This gentleman,
having done much to increase the material interests
of his native State, entered with pertinacity
into a process of rendering, as he claimed, the
position of Maine in history more conspicuous.
This required the aggrandizement of the fame
of Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and he began his
missionary work with a vindication of Gorges’
claims to be considered the father of English
colonization in America. It was no new idea,
for George Folsom had done Gorges justice in
his <i>Discourse</i> in 1846. Mr. Poor’s lecture was
printed, and was subsequently appended to the
<i>Popham Memorial</i>. To emphasize this claim,
he secured the naming of a new fort in Portland
Harbor after Sir Ferdinando in 1860; and in
1862, when the General Government built a fortification
on the old peninsula of Sabino, his
efforts caused it to be named Fort Popham, and
his zeal planned and directed a commemorative
service in August of that year on the spot, when
a tablet recounting the claims of which he was
the champion was placed near its walls. The
address which he then delivered, which showed
the intemperance, if not the perversity, of an
iconoclast, and which appeared with other papers
and addresses more or less pronounced in the
same way in a <i>Popham Memorial</i>, opened the
controversy. See also <i>Historical Magazine</i>, Jan.
1863, and Sept. 1866, and Mr. C. W. Tuttle’s
account of Mr. Poor’s agency in a “Memorial of
J. A. Poor,” in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
Oct. 1872. The committee charged with the
preparation of the <i>Memorial</i> unwisely omitted
a counter speech of the late J. Wingate Thornton,
on “The Colonial Schemes of Popham and
Gorges,” which was accordingly printed in the
<i>Congregational Quarterly</i>, April, 1863, and separately,
and is examined favorably by Abner C.
Goodell in the <i>Essex Institute Collections</i>, Aug.
1863, p. 175. A similar unfavorable estimate of
Popham’s colonists had been taken by R. H.
Gardiner in the <i>Maine Historical Collections</i>, ii.
269; v. 226.</p>

<p>For some years the spirit was kept alive by
recurrent commemorations. Mr. Edward E.
Bourne (see memoir of him in <i>N. E. Hist and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1874, p. 9, and <i>Me. Hist. Coll.</i>,
viii. 386) answered the detractors in an address,
“The Character of the Colony founded by George
Popham,” Portland, 1864. The statements of
Poor and Bourne led to a review by S. F. Haven
in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April 26, 1865,
and in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i> (Dec. 1865, p. 358; March,
July, Sept., Nov., 1867; Feb. and May, 1869).
There was a dropping fire on both sides for some
time. Meanwhile the address in 1865 by James
W. Patterson, on <i>The Responsibilities of the Founders
of Republics</i>, led to a controversy between
William F. Poole attacking, and Rev. Edward
Ballard and Frederick Kidder defending, the
colonists; and their papers were printed together
as <i>The Popham Colony: a Discussion of its Historic
Claims</i>, to which Mr. Poole appended a bibliography
of the subject up to 1866. Poole also
gave his view of Gorges and the colony in his
edition of Johnson’s <i>Wonder Working Providence</i>,
and in the <i>North American Review</i>, Oct. 1868.
At the celebration in 1871 Mr. Charles Deane
reviewed the erroneous conclusions presented at
earlier anniversaries, in a paper on “Early Voyages
to New England, and their Influence on
Colonization,” which was printed in the <i>Boston
Daily Advertiser</i>, Sept. 2, 1871. A paper by R. K.
Sewall on “Popham’s Town of Fort St. George,”
which contains a summary of the arguments and
events on the side of its historic importance, is
given in the <i>Me. Hist. Coll.</i>, vii., accompanied
by a map of the region. The latest statement of
the claim, apart from the review in the Preface
to <i>The Voyage to Sagadahoc</i>, referred to on an
earlier page, is in General Chamberlain’s <i>Maine</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<i>her Place in History</i>, which is too moderate to
provoke any criticism. Thus a reaction that at
one time claimed the necessity of rewriting history,
has in the end engaged few advocates, and
is almost lost sight of.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>D.</b> <span class="smcap">Captain John Smith’s Publications.</span>&mdash;The

fifty pounds or upwards. There is some bibliographical
detail regarding it in the <i>Memorial

versions of it were included in De Bry,

<p>A little tract of Smith’s, <i>New England’s
Trials</i> [<i>i. e.</i> Attempts at Settlements], needs to
be taken in connection with the <i>Description</i>. Of
this tract, of eight pages, published in 1620, there
is no copy known in America, and Mr. Deane
describes it and reprints it in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i> xii. 428, 449, from the Bodleian copy, which
differs in the names of the dedication from the
British Museum copy. In 1622 it was issued in
a second edition, enlarged to fourteen pages,
which is also very rare, though copies are in
the Deane Collection and in that of John Carter-Brown,
from the last of which a privately
printed reprint has been made. It was this text
which Force used in his <i>Tracts</i>, ii. See <i>Brinley
Catalogue</i>, no. 363.</p>

<p>Smith had moved, April 12, 1621, in a meeting
of the Virginia Company, that its official
sanction should be given to a compiled history
of “that country, from her first discovery to this
day,” showing that the purpose of his <i>Generall
Historie</i> was then in his mind. (Neill’s <i>Virginia
Company</i>, p. 210.) The first edition of it was
issued in 1624, and in it he included, besides abstracts
of various other writings, substantially
all his previous publications on America (see the
chapter on Virginia in the present volume), except
his <i>True Relation</i>, in the place of which he
had put the <i>Map of Virginia</i>, a tract covering the
same transactions. When reissued in 1626 it
was from the same type, and again in 1627, and
twice in 1632. An account of the various editions
in the Lenox Library, which differ only in
the front matter and plates, can be found in Norton’s
<i>Literary Gazette</i>, new ser. i. pp. 134 <i>a</i>, 218 <i>c</i>.
Mr. Deane has printed a part of the original
prospectus. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ix. 454.</p>

<p>The best opportunity for studying the slight
diversities of the different issues of this book
may be found in the Lenox Library, which has
ten copies, showing all the varieties. Among
other copies, the following are noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>1624., Charles Deane. A large paper dedication
copy of this edition, bound for Smith’s
patron, the Duchess of Richmond and Lenox,
was bought, at the Brinley Sale in 1879, no. 364,
for the Lenox Library, $1,800. The Menzies and
Barlow copies are also called large paper ones.
See <i>Griswold Catalogue</i>, no. 778; Field’s <i>Ind.
Bibliog.</i> no. 1435. The <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, p. 1367,
gives a copy of this edition in the original rich
binding, showing the arms of the Duke of Norfolk
quartered with those of his wife, the daughter
of the Duchess of Richmond and Lenox.</p>

<p>1626., Harvard College Library. Sparks’s
Collection, now at Cornell University, no. 2424.</p>

<p>1627., Prince Library in Boston Public Library.
Massachusetts Historical Society. See
the <i>Crowninshield Catalogue</i>, no. 992.</p>

<p>1631., The <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, p. 1367, gives,
perhaps by error, an edition of this date. I
have noted no other copy.</p>

<p>1632., Harvard College Library.</p>

<p>The two portraits of the Duchess of Richmond
and of Matoaka are usually wanting. See
the note to chapter v. Average copies without
the genuine portraits, which in Rich’s day (1832)
were worth five guineas, are now valued at
more than three times that sum. The portrait
of Smith, which is shown reduced on the map
of New England already given, has been similarly
reproduced full size in the <i>Memorial History
of Boston</i>, i., and is engraved in the Richmond
edition of the <i>Generall Historie</i>, in Bancroft,
Drake’s <i>Boston</i>, Hillard’s <i>Life of Smith, N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Jan. 1858, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>Generall Historie</i>, in conjunction with
the <i>True Travels</i>, was carelessly reprinted at
Richmond, in 1819, at the cost of the Rev. John
Holt Rice, D.D., who lost by the speculation.
(<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1877, p. 114.) A
large part appeared in Purchas’s <i>Pilgrims</i>, iv.
1838. It is given entire in Pinkerton’s <i>Collections
of Voyages</i>, xiii.</p>

<p>It is the sixth book of this <i>Generall Historie</i>
which relates to New England, and in this Smith
supplements his own experience, and brings the
details down beyond the limits of this present
chapter, by borrowing from <i>Mourt’s Relation</i> and
reporting upon other accounts, as he did in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
still later publication, the tract called <i>Advertisements
for the Unexperienced Planters of New
England</i>, which brings the story down to 1630.</p>

<p>Dr. Palfrey has a note on the confidence to be
reposed in Smith’s books, in his <i>History of New
England</i>, i. 89.</p>

<p>Smith was born in 1579 at Willoughby, as
the parish records show. (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 313;
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ix. 451.) He died June 21,
1631, signing his will the same day (<i>Ibid.</i> ix.
452), and was buried in St. Sepulchre’s, London,
where the inscription above his grave is said to
be now illegible. A committee of the American
Antiquarian Society was appointed in 1874 to see
to its restoration, but were prevented from acting
by the demand of a fee for the privilege from the
vestry of the church. (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, 1874, p. 222.) In Sparks’s <i>American Biography</i>
is a memoir of him by George S. Hillard;
another, by W. Gilmore Simms, was printed in
1846; and a recent study of his life and writings
has been made by C. D. Warner, who says that
the inscription, with the three (Turks’?) heads
in St. Sepulchre’s, long supposed to mark the
grave of Smith, is proved to commemorate some
one who died in September, aged 66, while Smith
died June, 1631, aged 51. Stow’s <i>Survey of London</i>,
1633, gives the long epitaph which could
be read on the walls of the church previous to
its destruction in the great London fire in 1666.

<p>Simon Passe, whose Latinized name we see
on the engraving of Smith’s map, was ten years
in England, and engraved many of the chief people
of the time; and as he was his own draughtsman,
it is probable the portrait of Smith was
drawn by Passe from life, though Robert Clerke
is credited with draughting the map.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>E.</b> <span class="smcap">Early Globes.</span>&mdash;The Molineaux globe
referred to in the text was constructed at the
instance of that great patron of navigation, William
Sanderson. (<i>Davis’s Voyages</i>, Introduction
by Markham, pp. xii. 211.) It is said to be the
earliest ever made in England. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. lix.) It
is two feet in diameter, and was completed in
1592. (Asher’s <i>Henry Hudson</i>, p. 274.) The
oldest globe known antedates it more than a
century, and of those intervening which are
known, the following, with the prototype, deserve
mention:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Martin Behaim’s, 1492, preserved in the
library at Nuremberg. It presents an open
ocean between Europe and Asia. The first
meridian runs through Madeira.
There is a copy in fac-simile
in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
at Paris. There have been engraved
delineations of it by Doppelmayr
at Nuremberg in 1730;
by Dr. Ghillany, in connection
with his <i>Geschichte des Seefahrers
Ritter Martin Behaim</i>, 1853; by
Jomard in his <i>Monuments de
la Géographie</i>, 1854-56, pl. 15.
There are sections and reductions
in Cladera’s <i>Investigaciones
Historicas</i>, Madrid, 1794; in Lelewel’s
<i>Moyen Age</i>; in the <i>Journal
of the Royal Geographical
Society</i>, xviii.; in Kohl’s <i>Discovery

editions of Irving’s <i>Columbus</i>;
in Bryant and Gay’s <i>United
States</i>, i. 103; and in Maury’s
paper in <i>Harper’s Monthly</i>, xlii.
(February, 1871).</p>

<p>2. Acquired from a friend in
Laon in 1860 by M. Leroux, of
the Administration de la Marine
at Paris, and represents the geographical
knowledge current at
Lisbon, 1486-87, according to
D’Avezac, who gives a projection of it in the
<i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>, 4th
series, viii. (1860). It is dated 1493. The first
meridian runs through Madeira.</p>

<p>3. A small copper globe in the Lenox Library,
in New York, which is said to be the earliest
globe to show the American coast, and its
date is fixed at about 1510-12, but by some as
early as 1506-7.</p>

<p>It was bought in Paris about
twenty-five years ago by R. M. Hunt, the architect,
and was given by him to Mr. Lenox. It
is about five inches in diameter. Dr. De Costa
has described it and given a draught of its geography
in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Sept. 1879. This
paper, translated by M. Gravier, appeared in the
<i>Bulletin de la Société normande de Géographie</i>,
1880. A projection of it is said to have been
made in the Coast Survey Bureau in 1869, at the
instance of Mr. Henry Stevens, and a reduction
of this is given in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
9th edition, x. 681, of which the Western Hemisphere
is herewith reproduced. The globe opens
on the line of the equator, and was probably
used as a pyx. It may be said to be the oldest
globe showing any part of the New World.</p>

<p>4. Brought to light in a <i>Catalogue de Livres
rares appartenant à M. H. Tross, année 1881</i>,
no. xiv. 4924, where a fac-simile by S. Pilinski
is given. The gores composing it are found in
a copy of the <i>Cosmographiæ Introductio</i>, supposed
to have been printed at Lugduni, 1514.
This is the claim of the <i>Catalogue</i>; but if it belonged
to the tract it could hardly have been
earlier than 1518. It is understood that the book
has been added to an American collection. The
plate is styled <i>Universalis Cosmographie Descriptio
tam in solido quem</i> [sic] <i>plano</i>, and is given
in twelve sections. The delineation of South
America is marked “America noviter reperta.”
It is claimed that this gives this copperplate,
“essentiellement française,” the honor of being
the earliest to bear the name of America,&mdash;that
credit having been claimed for the woodcut map
in Camer’s edition of Solinus, 1520. The manuscript
delineation by Leonardo da Vinci, also
giving the name, and preserved at Windsor in
the Queen’s collection, probably antedates it.</p>

<p>5. Made by Johann Schoner at Bamberg in
1520, preserved in the library at Nuremberg,
and thought, until the discovery of the Lenox
globe, to be the earliest showing the discoveries
in America. The northern section is still
broken up into islands large and small; but
South America is delineated with approximate
correctness. Dr. Ghillany gave a representation
of the American hemisphere in the <i>Jahresbericht
der technischen Anstalten in Nürnberg
für 1842</i>; also see his <i>Erdglobus von Behaim
vom Jahre 1492, und der des Joh. Schoner von
1520</i>, Nürnberg, 1842, p. 18, two plates. Humboldt
examines this Schoner globe in his <i>Examen
critique</i>, and in his Appendix to Ghillany’s
<i>Ritter Behaim</i>, where a reproduction is given.
There are also delineations or sections in Lelewel’s
<i>Moyen Age</i>; in Kohl’s <i>Discovery of Maine</i>;
in Santarem’s <i>Atlas</i>; and in Maury’s paper in
<i>Harper’s Monthly</i>, February, 1871. Schoner published,
in 1515, a <i>Terræ totius descriptio</i>, without
a map, of which there are copies in Harvard
College Library and the Carter-Brown Collection
at Providence.</p>

<p>6. Preserved at Frankfort-on-the-Main; of
unknown origin. It is figured in Jomard’s
<i>Monuments de la Géographie</i>. See also the <i>Journal
of the Royal Geographical Society</i>, xviii. 45. It
resembles Schoner’s, and Wieser ascribes it to
that maker, and dates it 1515. It is 10½ inches in
diameter, and by some the date is fixed at 1520.</p>

<p>7. Given by Duke Charles V. of Lorraine
to the church at Nancy, and opening in the
middle, long used there as a pyx, is now preserved
in the Public Library in that town, and
was described (with an engraving) by M. Blau
in the <i>Mémoires de la Société royale de Nancy</i>, in
1836, and again in the <i>Compte-Rendu, Congrès
des Américanistes</i>, 1877, p. 359, and from a
photograph by Dr. DeCosta, in the <i>Magazine
of American History</i>, March, 1881. It makes
North America the eastern part of Asia, and
transforms Norumbega into Anorombega. It
is made of silver, gilt, and is six inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>8. Supposed to be of Spanish origin; preserved
in the Bibliothèque Nationale, at Paris,
and formerly belonged to the brothers De Bure.
It bears a close resemblance to the Frankfort
globe.</p>

<p>9. In the custody of the successors of Canon
L’Ecuy of Prémontré. It is without date, and
D’Avezac fixed it before 1524; others put it
about 1540. It is the first globe to show North
America disconnected from Asia. It is said to
be now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, at Paris.
Cf. Raemdonck, <i>Les Sphères de Mercator</i>, p. 28.</p>

<p>10. What was thought to be the only copy
known of one of Gerard Mercator’s engraved
globes was bought at the sale of M. Benoni-Verelst,
at Ghent, in May, 1868, by the Royal
Library at Brussels. In 1875 it was reproduced
in twelve plane gores at Brussels, in folio, as a
part of <i>Sphère terrestre et sphère céleste de Gerard
Mercator, éditées à Louvain en 1541 et 1551</i>, and
one of the sections is inscribed, “<span class="smcap">Edebat Gerardus
Mercator Rupelmundanus cum
privilegio ces: Maiestatis ad an sex Lovanii
an 1541</span>.” Only two hundred copies of the
fac-simile were printed. There are copies in
the Library of the State Department at Washington,
of Harvard College, and of the American
Geographical Society, New York. The outline
of the eastern coast of America is shown
with tolerable accuracy, though there is no indication
of the discoveries of Cartier in the
St. Lawrence Gulf and River, made a few years
earlier. In 1875 a second original was discovered
in the Imperial Court Library at Vienna;
and a third is said to exist at Weimar.</p>

<p>11. Of copper, made apparently in Italy,&mdash;at
Rome, or Venice,&mdash;by Euphrosynus Ulpius in
1542, is fifteen and one half inches in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was bought in 1859 out of a collection of a dealer
in Spain by Buckingham Smith, and is now in
the Cabinet of the New York Historical Society.
The first meridian runs through the Canaries,
and it shows the demarcation line of Pope Alexander
VI. It is described in the <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, 1862, p. 302, and the American parts
are engraved in B. Smith’s <i>Inquiry into the
Authenticity of Verrazano’s Claims</i>, and Henry
C. Murphy’s <i>Verrazzano</i>, p. 114. See Harrisse,
<i>Notes sur la Nouvelle France</i>, no. 291. The fullest
description, accompanied by engravings of it, is
given by B. F. De Costa in the <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, January, 1879; and in his <i>Verrazano
the Explorer</i>, New York, 1881, p. 64.</p>

<p>Mr. C. H. Coote, in his paper on “Globes”
in the new edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
x. 680, mentions two other globes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sixteenth century, which may antedate that of
Molineaux, both by A. F. van Langren,&mdash;one in
the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, and the
other, discovered in 1855, in the Bibliothèque
de Grenoble.</p>

<p>The globe-makers immediately succeeding
Molineaux were W. J. Blaeu (1571-1638) and
his son John Blaeu, and their work is rare at
this day. Mr. P. J. H. Baudet, in his <i>Leven
en werken van W. J. Blaeu</i>, Utrecht, 1871, reports
finding but two pair of his (Blaeu’s) globes
(terrestrial and celestial) in Holland. His first
editions bore date 1599, but he constantly corrected
the copper plates, from which he struck
the gores. Muller, of Amsterdam, offered a
pair, in 1877, for five hundred Dutch florins,
and in his <i>Books on America</i>, iii. 164, another
at seven hundred and fifty florins. (<i>Catalogue</i>,
1877, no. 329.) A pair, dated 1606, was in
the Stevens sale, 1881. <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i., no. 1335.</p>

<p>I find no trace of the globe of Hondius,
1597, which gives the American discoveries up
to that date. See <i>Davis’s Voyages</i> (Hakluyt
Society), p. 351. Hondius and Langeren were
rivals.</p>

<p><b>F.</b> <span class="smcap">Molineaux Map, 1600.</span>&mdash;Emeric Molineaux,
the alleged maker of this map, belonged
to Lambeth, “a rare gentleman in his profession,
being therein for divers years greatly supported
by the purse and liberality of the worshipful
merchant, Mr. William Sanderson.”
Captain Markham (<i>Davis’s Voyages</i>, Hakluyt
Society, London, 1880, pp. xxxiii, lxi, also
p. lxxxviii) is of the opinion that the true author
is Edward Wright, the mathematician, who
perfected and rendered practicable what we
know to-day as Mercator’s projection,&mdash;first demonstrating
it in his Certain Errors in Navigation
Detected, 1599, and first introducing its
formulæ accurately in the 1600 map. Hakluyt
had spoken of the globe by Molineaux in his
1589 edition, but it was not got ready in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
for his use. The map followed the globe, but
was not issued till about 1600, the discoveries
of Barentz in 1596 being the last indicated on
it. It measures 16½ × 25 inches. Quaritch
in 1875 advanced the theory that the globe
of Molineaux was referred to in Shakespeare’s
<i>Twelfth Night</i> (act iii. sc. 2), as the “new
map.” (Quaritch’s 1879 <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 321,
book no. 11919),&mdash;a theory made applicable to
the map and sustained by C. H. Coote in 1878,
in <i>Shakespeare’s “new map” in Twelfth Night</i>
(also in <i>Transactions</i> of the New Shakspere
Society, 1877-79, i. 88-100), and reasserted in
the Hakluyt Society’s edition of <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>,
p. lxxxv. Henry Stevens (<i>Hist. Coll.</i> i. 200),
however, is inclined to refer Shakespeare’s reference
(“the new map with the augmentation
of the Indies”) to the “curious little round-face
shaped map” in Wytfliet’s <i>Ptolemæum Augmentum</i>,
1597.</p>

<p>The Molineaux-Wright map has gained
reputation from Hallam’s reference to it in his
<i>Literature of Europe</i> as “the best map of the
sixteenth century.” It is now accessible in the
autotype reproduction which was made by Mr.
Quaritch from the Grenville copy of Hakluyt’s
<i>Principall Navigations</i> in the British Museum,
and which accompanies the Hakluyt Society’s
edition of <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>. There are nine
copies of the map known, as follows: 1. King’s
Library. 2. Grenville Library. 3. Cracherode
Copy. (These three are in the British Museum.)
4. Admiralty Office. 5. Lenox Library, New
York. 6. University of Cambridge. 7. Christie
Miller’s Collection. 8. Middle Temple. 9. A
copy in Quaritch’s Catalogue, 1881, no. 340,
title-number, 6235, which had previously appeared
in the Stevens sale, <i>Hist. Collections</i>, i.
199. Quaritch held the Hakluyt (3 vols.) with
this genuine map at £156, and it is said no
other copy had been sold since the Bright
sale.</p>

<p>It may be noted that Blundeville, who in his
<i>Exercises</i>, pp. 204-42, describes the Mercator and
Molineaux globes, also, pp. 245-78, gives a long
account of a mappamundi by Peter Plancius,
dated 1592, of which Linschoten, in 1594, gives
a reduction.</p>


<p><b>G.</b> <span class="smcap">Modern Collections of Early
Maps.</span>&mdash;The collections of reproductions of the
older maps, showing portions of the American
coast, and representing what may be termed the
beginnings of modern cartography, are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jomard, E. F.</span> <i>Les Monuments de la Géographie.</i>
Paris, 1866. The death of Jomard in
1862 (see Memoir by M. de la Roquette, in <i>Bulletin
de la Soc. Géog.</i> February, 1863, or 5th ser.
v. 81, with a portrait; Cortambert’s <i>Vie et Œuvres
de Jomard</i>, Paris, 1868, 20 pages; and <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, iv. 232, vi. 334) prevented the completion
by him of the text which he intended
should accompany the plates. M. D’Avezac’s
intention to supply it was likewise stayed by his
death, in 1875. It proved, however, that Jomard
had left behind what he had meant for an introduction
to the text; and this was printed in
a pamphlet at Paris in 1879, as <i>Introduction à
l’Atlas des Monuments de la Géographie</i>, edited
by E. Cortambert. It is a succinct account of
the progress of cartography before the times of
Mercator and Ortelius. The atlas contains five
maps, of great interest in connection with American
discovery:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi4 p1 reduct">The Frankfort Globe, <i>circa</i> 1520.<br />

the most extensive of modern fac-similes. Copies,
which are rarely found complete, owing to
its irregular publication over a long period, are
worth from $175 to $200. A list of the maps in
it is given in Leclerc, <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>,
1878, no. 529; and of them the following are of
interest to students of American history:&mdash;</p>

<p>51. Mappemonde de Ruysch. This appeared

<p>A series of photographic reproductions of
early maps is now appearing at Venice, under
the title of <i>Raccolta di Mappamondi e Carte nautiche
del XIII al XVI secolo</i>. There are two which
have a particular interest in connection with the
earliest explorations in America; namely,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pind2 p1">16. <i>Carta da navigare.</i> Attributed to <span class="smcap">Alberto
Cantino</span>, supposed to be A.D. 1501-03,
and to illustrate the third voyage of Columbus.
The original is in the Bibl. Estense
at Modena. [Not yet published.]</p>

<p class="pind2">17. <span class="smcap">Agnese, Battista.</span> <i>Fac-simile delle Carte
nautiche dell’ anno 1554, illustrate da Teobaldo
Fischer.</i> Venezia. 1881.</p>

<p class="p1">The editor, Fischer, is Professor of Geography
at Kiel. The original is in the Bibliotheca
Marciana, at Venice. The sheets which throw
light upon the historical geography of America
are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>XVII. 4. North America northward to the
Penobscot and the Gulf of California; and the
west coast of South America to 15° south; then
blank, till the region of Magellan’s Straits is
reached.</p>

<p>XVII. 5. North America, east coast from
Labrador south; Central America; South America,
all of east coast, and west coast, as in XVII. 4.</p>

<p>XVII. 33. The World,&mdash;the American continent
much as in XVII. 4 and 5.</p>

<p>We note the following other maps of Agnese:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Portolano in the British Museum, bearing
date 1536. <i>Index to MSS. in British Museum</i>,
19,927. If this is the one Kohl (<i>Discovery of
Maine</i>, p. 293) refers to as no. 5,463, MS. Department
British Museum, it is signed and dated
by the author.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Portolano, dated 1536, in the royal library
at Dresden, of ten plates,&mdash;one being the World,
the western half of which, showing America, is
given reduced by Kohl, p. 292. It resembles
XVII. 33, above, but is not so well advanced,
and retains a trace of Verrazano’s Sea, which
makes New England an isthmus. It wants the
California peninsula, a knowledge of whose discovery
had hardly yet reached Venice.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Portolano, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford;
thought by Kohl, who gives a sketch (pl. xv. c),
to be the work of Agnese, since it closely resembles,
in its delineations of the American continent,
that Venetian’s notions. This, perhaps, is
earlier than the previous map; for it puts a strait
leading to the Western sea, where Cartier had
just before supposed he had found such in the
St. Lawrence.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Map in the archives of the Duke of Coburg-Gotha,
marked “Baptista Agnes fecit, Venetiis,
1543, die 18 Febr.” Kohl (pl. xvii. 3) gives
from it a draft of the eastern coast of the United

<p class="pc1 mid">THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT IN THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW
ENGLAND.&mdash;PURITANS AND SEPARATISTS IN ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GEORGE EDWARD ELLIS,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Vice-President of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE is no occasion to offer any elaborate plea for making this
theme the subject of a chapter of American history, however extended
into detail or compressed in its dealing with general themes that
history might be. In the origin and development, the strengthening and
the triumph, of those agencies which transferred from the Old World to
the New the trial of fresh ideas and the experiment with free institutions,
the colonists of New England had the leading part. The influence and the
institutions which have gone forth from them have had a prevailing sway
on the northern half of this continent. Their enterprise&mdash;in its seemingly
feeble, but from the first earnest and resolute, purpose&mdash;took its spring
from religious dissension following upon the earlier stages of the Protestant
Reformation in England. The grounds, occasions, and results of that dissension
thus become the proper subject of a chapter in American history.
It is certain that in tracing the early assertion in England of what may be
called the principles of dissent from ecclesiastical authority, we are dealing
with forces which have wrought effectively on this continent.</p>

<p>The well-established and familiar fact, that the first successful and effective
colonial enterprises of Englishmen in New England found their motive
and purpose in religious variances within the English communion, is illustrated
by an incident anticipatory by several years of the period which
realized that result. A scheme was devised and entered upon in England
in the interest of substantially the same class of men known as Separatists
and Nonconformists, who twenty-three years afterward established themselves
at Plymouth, and ten years later in Massachusetts Bay. In the year
1597, there were confined in London prisons a considerable number of men
known confusedly as Barrowists or Brownists, who had been seized in the
conventicles of the Separatists, or had made themselves obnoxious by disaffection
with the government, the forms, or the discipline of the English
hierarchy. In that year a scheme was proposed, apparently by the Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
for planting some permanent colonists somewhere in the northern
parts of North America. Some of these Separatists petitioned the Council
for leave to transport themselves for this purpose, promising fidelity to the
Queen and her realm. Three merchants at the time were planning a voyage
for fishing and discovery, with a view to a settlement on an island
variously called Rainea, Rainée, and Ramees, in a group of the Magdalen
Islands, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and they were to furnish two ships for
the enterprise. Reinforcing the petition of the Separatists, they asked permission
to transport with them “divers artificers and other persons that are
noted to be Sectaries, whose minds are continually in an ecclesiastical ferment.”
Permission was granted for the removal of two such persons in
each of the two ships, the merchants giving bonds that the exiles should
not return unless willing to obey the ecclesiastical laws. The four prisoners
who embarked for the voyage, April 8, 1597, were Francis and George
Johnson, brothers, who had been educated at Cambridge, and Daniel
Studley and John Clarke, who shared with them their Separatist principles.
One of the vessels was wrecked when near its destination, and the
company took refuge on the other, which, proving unseaworthy and scantily
provisioned, returned to England, arriving in the Channel, September 1.
The four exiles found their way stealthily to a hiding-place in London, and
by the middle of the month were in Amsterdam. Their history there connects
with the subsequent fortunes of the Separatists in England, and with
those of the Pilgrims at Plymouth.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The facts, persons, and incidents with which we have to deal in treating
of this special matter of religious contention within the English Church,
give us simply the opening in series and course of what under various
modifications is known as the history of Dissent. The strife then engendered
has continued essentially the same down to our own times, turning
upon the same points of controversy and upon contested principles, rights,
and methods. The present relations of the parties to this entailed dissension
may throw some light back upon the working of the elements in it
when it was first opened. The result which has been reached, after the
processes engaged in it for nearly four centuries, shows itself to us in a
still existing National Church establishment in England, with authority
and vested rights, privileges, and prerogatives, yet nevertheless repudiated
by nearly, if not quite, half of the subjects of the realm. The reason or
the right, the grounds or the justification, of the original workings of Dissent
have certainly been suspended long enough for discussion and judgment
upon their merits to help us to reach a fair decision upon them.</p>

<p>The indifference, even the strong distaste, which writers and readers alike
feel to a rehearsal in our days of the embittered and aggravated strife,&mdash;often
concerned too, with what seem to us petty, trivial, and perverse elements of
scruple, temper, and passion,&mdash;in the early Puritan controversy in the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of England, may be sensibly relieved by the spirit of fairness and consideration
in which the subject is treated in the most recent dealing with it by
able and judicious writers. There are even now in the utterances of pulpit
and platform, and in the voluminous pages of pamphlet, essay, and so-called
history, survivals and renewals of all the sharpness and acrimoniousness of
the original passions of the controversy. And where this spirit has license,
the lengthening lapse of time will more or less falsify the truth of the relation
of either side of the strife. One whose sympathies are with either
party may rightly claim that it be fairly presented, its limitations, excesses,
and even its perversities being excused or palliated, where reasons can
be shown. Nor is one who for any fair purpose undertakes a statement
or exposition of the views and course of either of those parties to be
regarded as also its champion and vindicator. But no rehearsal of the
controversy will have much value or interest for readers of our day which
does assume such championship of one party. As the Puritans, Nonconformists,
or Dissenters, from the beginning up to this day, were substantially
defeated, disabled, and made the losers of the object for which
they contended, they may fairly claim the allowance of making the best
possible statement of their cause.</p>

<p>Those who at this distance of time accede in their lineage and principles
to the heritage of the first Dissenters from the English Church system,
might naturally eulogize them for their noble service in laying the foundations
of religious and civil liberty in the realm. But there are not lacking
in these days Royalists and Churchmen alike who in the pages of history and
in essays equally extol the English Nonconformists as the foremost champions,
the most effective agents, in bringing to trial and triumph the free
institutions of the realm. Making the fullest allowances for all the perversities
and fanaticisms wrought in with the separating tenets and principles
of individuals and sects, their protests and assertions, their sufferings and
constancy under disabilities, all wrought together at last to insure a grand
result. Boldly is the assertion now maintained, that the Church of England
at several critical periods would have been unable to withstand the recuperative
forces of the Roman Church, had it not been for the persistent
action of the Nonconformists in holding the ground won by the Reformation,
and in demanding advance in the same line. The partial schemes
of toleration and comprehension which were hopefully or mockingly entertained
by parties in the Government down to the period of the Revolution,
were avowedly designed “to strengthen the Protestant interest.” The
strength of Dissent, in all its forms and stages, lay in its demanding for
the laity voice and influence in all ecclesiastical affairs. It was this that
restrained the dominance of priestly power.</p>

<p>There is a very important consideration to be had in view when we aim
to form a fair and impartial judgment of the spirit and course of those
earnest, if contentious, men, scholars, divines, heads and fellows of universities,
who in their Nonconforming or Separatist principles originated dissensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
in the English Church, and withdrew from it, bearing various pains
and penalties. Even in the calmer dealing with them in the religious literature
of our own times coming from Episcopal writers, we find traces of
the irritation, reproach, and contempt felt and expressed for these original
Dissenters when they first came into notice, to be dealt with as mischief-makers
and culprits. They were then generally regarded as unreasonable,
perverse, and contentious spirits, exaggerating trifling matters, obtruding
morbid scruples, and keeping the realm in a ferment of petty squabbles
on subjects in themselves utterly indifferent. They withstood the hearty,
harmonious engagement of the rulers and the mass of the people of the
realm in the difficult task of securing the general principles and interests
of the Reformation, when perils and treacheries of a most formidable character
from the Papacy and from internal and external enemies threatened
every form of disaster. To this charge it might be replied, that the Puritans
believed that a thorough and consistent work of reformation within the
realm would be the best security for loyalty, internal harmony, and protection
from the plottings of all outside enemies.</p>

<p>The most interesting and significant fact underlying the origin and the
principles alike of Nonconformity and of Separatism in England at the
period of the Reformation, is this: the facility and acquiescence with which
changes were made in the English ecclesiastical system up to a certain
point, while further modifications in the same direction were so stiffly
resisted. It would seem as if it had been assumed at once that there was
a well-defined line of division which should sharply distinguish between
what must necessarily or might reasonably be made a part of the new
order of things when the Papacy was renounced, and what must be conserved
against all further innovation. The pivot of all subsequent controversy,
dissension, and alienation turned upon the question whether this
sharply drawn line was not wholly an arbitrary one, not adjusted by a
principle of consistency, but of the nature of a compromise. This question
was followed by another: Why should the process of reformation in
the Church, so resolute and revolutionary in changing its institution and
discipline and ritual, stop at the stage which it has already reached? Could
any other answer be given than that the majority, or those who in office or
prerogative had the power to enforce a decision, had decided that the right
point had been reached, and that an arrest must be made there?</p>

<p>We must indicate in a summary way the stage which the Reformation
had reached in England when Puritanism, in its various forms, made itself
intrusive and obnoxious in demanding further changes. We need not open
and deal with the controverted point, about which English Churchmen are
by no means in accord, as to whether their Church had or did not have an
origin and jurisdiction independently of all agency, intrusion, or intervention
of the Bishop of Rome, or the Pope. It is enough to start with the
fact, that up to the reign of Henry VIII. the Pope asserted and exercised
a supremacy both in civil and in ecclesiastical affairs in the realm. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was a Church in England, it was allowed that that Church must have a
head. The Pope was acknowledged to be that head. Henry VIII., with
the support of his Parliament, renounced the Papal supremacy, and himself
acceded to that august dignity. The year 600 is assigned as the date when
Pope Gregory I. put Augustin, or Austin, over the British Church. The
headship of the Pope was acknowledged in the line of monarchs till Henry
VIII. became the substitute of Clement VII. In the twenty-sixth year of
Henry’s reign his Parliament enacted that “whatsoever his Majesty should
enjoin in matters of religion should be obeyed by all his subjects.” Some
of the clergy, being startled at this exaltation of a layman to the highest
ecclesiastical office, demanded the insertion of the qualifying words “as
far as is agreeable to the laws of Christ.” The King for a time accepted
this qualification, but afterward obtained the consent of Parliament for its
omission. Whatever may be granted or denied to the well-worn plea that
the King’s reformatory zeal was inspired by his feud with the Pope about
his matrimonial infelicities, it is evident that, notwithstanding the unrestrained
royal prerogative, the monarch could not have struck at the very
basis of all ecclesiastical rule and order in his kingdom, had there not been
not only in his Council and Parliament, but also working among all orders
of the people, a spirit and resolve against the Papal rule and discipline,
ready to enter upon the unsounded and perilous ventures of radical reformation.
None as yet knew where the opened way would lead them. The
initiatory and each onward step might yet have to be retraced. Not for
many years afterward did the threat and dread of the full restoration of the
Papal power cease to appal the people of the realm. The final and the
impotent blow which severed the Papacy from the realm came in the Bull
of Pope Pius V. in 1571, which denounced Elizabeth as a heretic, and,
under pain of curse, forbade her subjects to obey her laws. The measures
of reform under Henry were tentative and arbitrary on his part. They
made no recognition of any defined aim and stage to be reached. We
must keep this fact in view as showing that while the realm was ready for
change, it was as yet a process, not a mark.</p>

<p>It is necessary to start with a definition of terms which are often confounded
in their use. “Puritans,” “Separatists,” and “Nonconformists”
might in fact be terms equally applicable to many individuals, but none
the less they were distinctive, and in many cases indicated very broad
divergencies and characteristics in opinion, belief, and conduct. Nonconformists
and Separatists were alike Puritans,&mdash;the latter intensively such.
Puritanism developed alike into Nonconformity and Separatism. The earliest
Puritans came to be Nonconformists, after trying in vain to retain a
ministry and communion in the English Church as established by royal
and civil authority, and after being driven from it because of their persistent
demands for further reform in it. As heartily as did those who
remained in its communion, they believed in the fitness of an established
nationalized Church. They wished to be members of such a Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
themselves; and not only so, but also to force upon others such membership.
It was not to destroy, but to purify; not to deny to the civil authority
a legislative and disciplinary power in religious matters, but to limit
the exercise of that right within Scriptural rules and methods. They had
sympathized in the processes of reform so far as these had advanced, but
complained that the work had been arbitrarily arrested, was incomplete,
was inconsistently pursued, was insecure in the stage which it had reached,
and so left without the warrant which Scripture alone could furnish as a
substitute for repudiated Rome.</p>

<p>Who were the Separatists, whose utterances, scruples, and conduct
seemed so whimsical, pertinacious, disloyal, and refractory in Old England,
and whose enterprise has been so successful and honorable in its development
in New England? When the unity of the Roman Church was sundered
at the Reformation, all those once in its communion who parted from it were
Separatists. It is an intricate but interesting story, which has been often told,
wearisomely and indeed exhaustively, in explanation of the fact that this
epithet came to designate a comparatively small number of individuals in
a nation to the mass of whose population it equally belonged. The term
“separatist” or “sectary” carries with it a changing significance and association,
according to the circumstances of its application. It was first used
to designate the Christians. The Apostle Paul was called “a ringleader of
the <i>sect</i> of the Nazarenes” (Acts xxiv. 5). The Roman Jews described the
Christians as a “<i>sect</i>” that was “everywhere spoken against” (Acts xxviii.
22). The civil power gave a distinctive limitation to the epithet. It is
always to be remembered that every national-church establishment existing
among Protestants is the creation of the civil authority. Its inclusion and
its exclusion, the privileges and disabilities which it gives or imposes, its
titles of honor or reproach, are the awards of secular magistrates. All
ecclesiastical polity, outside of Scriptural rule and sanction, receives its authority,
for those who accept and for those who reject it, from the extension
of the temporal power into the province of religion. When King Henry
VIII. and the English Parliament assumed the ecclesiastical headship and
prerogative previously exercised by Pope Clement VII., all the loyal people
of the realm became Separatists. All the Reformed bodies of the Continent
substantially regarded themselves as coming under that designation,
which might have been applied and assumed with equal propriety as the
epithet “protestants.” The Curia of the hierarchy at Rome from the first
until now regards English and all other Protestants as Separatists. An
archbishop or bishop of the English Church is ranked by the Church of
Rome in the same category of unauthorized intruders upon sacred functions
with the second-advent exhorter and the field-preacher. The pages
of English history, so diligently wrought, and the developments of ecclesiastical
polity in the realm must be studied and traced by one who would
fully understand the occasion, the grounds, and the justice of the restriction
which confined the title of “separatists” to the outlawed and persecuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and exiled class of persons, many of them graduates of English universities,
ordained and serving in the pulpits of the Church, who were represented in
and out of English jails by the four men whose abortive scheme of planting
a colony in North America has just been referred to. However, justly
or unjustly, the epithet “separatists” came to be applied and accepted as
designating those who would not only not conform to the discipline of the
Church, as still members of it, but who utterly renounced all connection
with it, kept away from it, and organized assemblies, conventicles, or fellowships,
subject only to such discipline as they might agree upon among
themselves.</p>

<p>A suggestion presents itself here, to which a candid view of facts must
attach much weight. Nonconformity, Separatism, Dissent, are not to be
regarded as factiously obtruding themselves upon a peaceful, orderly, and
well-established system, already tried and approved in its general workings.
The Reformation in England was then but in progress, in its early stages;
everything had been shaken, all was still unsettled, unadjusted, not reduced
to permanence and order. There was an experiment to be tried, an institution
to be recreated and remodelled, a substitute Church to be provided
for a repudiated Church. The early Dissenters regarded themselves as simply
taking part in an unfinished reform. The Church in England, under
entanglements of civil policy and complications of State, gave tokens of
stopping at a stage in reform quite different from that reached, and allowed
progressive advance and unfettered conditions among Protestants on the
Continent. There the course was free. The French, Dutch, and Italian
systems, though not accordant, were all unlike the English ecclesiastical
system. In England it was impeded, leading to a kind of establishment
and institution in hierarchical and ritual administration which had more
regard for the old Church, and looked to more compromise with it. It
was not as if yielding to their own crotchets, self-willed idiosyncrasies, and
petty fancies that those who opened the line of the Dissenters obtruded
their variances, scruples, and contentions in assailing what was already
established and perfected. They meant to come in at the beginning, at
the first stage, the initiation of what was to be the new order of things in
the Church, which was then, as they viewed it, in a state of formation and
organization for time to come. They took alarm at the simulation of the
system and ritual of the Roman Church, which the English, alone of all
the Reformed Churches, in their view evidently favored. They wished to
have hand and voice in initiating and planning the ecclesiastical institutions
under which they were to live as Christians. Individual conscience,
too, which heretofore had been a nullity, was thenceforward to stand for
something. It remained to be proved how much and what was to be allowed
to it, but it was not to be scornfully slighted. Then, also, with the first
manifestations of a Nonconforming and Separatist spirit, we note the agitation
of the question, which steadily strengthened in its persistency and
emphasis of treatment, as to what were to be the rights and functions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
lay people in the administration of a Christian Church. Were they to
continue, as under the Roman system, simply to be led, governed, and
disciplined, as sheep in a fold, by a clerical order? Hallam gives it as his
conclusion, that the party in the realm during Elizabeth’s reign “adverse
to any species of ecclesiastical change,” was less numerous than either of
the other parties, Catholic or Puritan. According to this view, if one third
of the people of the realm would have consented to the restoration of the
Roman system, and less than one third were in accord with the Protestant
prelatical establishment, certainly the other third, the Puritanical party,
might assert their right to a hearing.</p>

<p>While claiming and pleading that the strict rule and example of Scripture
precedent and model should alone be followed in the institution and
discipline of the Christian Church, there was a second very comprehensive
and positive demand made by the Puritans, which,&mdash;as we shall calmly view
it in the retrospect, as taking its impulse and purpose either from substantial
and valid reasons of good sense, discretion, and practical wisdom, or as
starting from narrow conceits, perversity, and eccentric judgments leading
it on into fanaticism,&mdash;put the Puritans into antagonism with the Church
party. From the first token of the breach with Rome under Henry VIII.
through the reigns of his three children and the four Stuarts, the Reformation
was neither accomplished in its process, nor secure of abiding in the
stage which it had reached. More than once during that period of one and
a half centuries there were not only reasonable fears, but actual evidences,
that a renewed subjection to the perfectly restored thraldom of Rome
might, in what seemed to be merely the cast of a die, befall the distracted
realm of England. The Court, Council, and Parliament pulsated in regular
or irregular beats between Romanism and Protestantism. Henry VIII.
left the work of reform embittered in its spirit for both parties, unaccomplished,
insecure, and with no settlement by fixed principles. His three
children, coming successively to the crown, pursued each a policy which
had all the elements of confusion, antagonism, inconsistency, and extreme
methods.</p>

<p>The spirit which vivified Puritanism had been working in England, and
had been defining and certifying its animating and leading principles, before
any formal measures of King and Parliament had opened the breach with
Rome. The elemental ferment began with the circulation and reading of
parts or the whole of the Scriptures in the English tongue. The surprises
and perils which accompanied the enjoyment of this fearful privilege by
private persons of acute intelligence and hearts sensitive to the deepest
religious emotions, were followed by profound effects. The book was to
them a direct, intelligible, and most authoritative communication from God.
To its first readers it did not seem to need any help from an interpreter
or commentator. It is a suggestive fact, that for English readers the now
mountainous heaps of literature devoted to the exposition, illustration, and
extended and comparative elucidation of Scripture were produced only at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a later period. The first Scripture readers, antedating the actual era of
the English Reformation and the formal national rupture with the Roman
Church, were content with the simple text. They were impatient with any
glosses or criticisms. When afterward, in the interests of psalmody in
worship, the first attempts were made in constructing metrical versions
of the Psalms, the intensest opposition was raised against the introduction
of a single expletive word for which there was no answering original in
the text.</p>

<p>We must assign to this early engagedness of love and devoted regard
and fond estimate of the Bible the mainspring and the whole guiding
inspiration of all the protests and demands which animated the Puritan
movements. The degree in which afterward any individual within the
communion of the English Church was prompted to pursue what he
regarded as the work of reformation, whether he were prelate, noble,
gentleman, scholar, husbandman, or artisan, and whether it drove him to
conformity or to any phase of Puritanism, or even Separatism, depended
mainly upon the estimate which he assigned to the Scriptures, whether as
the sole or only the co-ordinate authority for the institution and discipline
of the Christian Church. The free and devout reading of the Scriptures,
when engaging the fresh curiosity and zeal of thoroughly earnest men
and women, roused them to an amazed surprise at the enormous discordance
between the matter and spirit of the sacred book and the ecclesiastical
institutions and discipline under which they had been living,&mdash;“the
simplicity that was in Christ,” constrasted with the towering corruptions
and the monstrous tyranny and thraldom of the Papacy! This first surprise
developed into all shades and degrees of protest, resentment, indignation,
and almost blinding passion. Those who are conversant with the
writings of either class of the Puritans know well with what paramount distinctness
and emphasis they use the term, “the Word.” The significance
attached to the expression gives us the key to Puritanism. For its most
forcible use was when, in a representative championship, it was made to
stand in bold antagonism with the term “the Church,” as inclusive of what
it carried with it alike under the Roman or the English prelatical system.
“The Church,” “the Scriptures,” are the word-symbols of the issue between
Conformity and Puritanism. Christ did not leave Scriptures behind
him, said one party, but he did leave a Church. Yes, replied the other
party; he left apostles who both wrote the Scriptures and planted and
administered the Church. The extreme to which the famous “Se-Baptist,”
John Smyth, carried this insistency upon the sole authority of the Scriptures,
led him to repudiate the use of the English Bible in worship, and
to require that the originals in Greek and Hebrew should be substituted.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
The fundamental distinguishing principle which is common to all the
phases of Puritanism, Dissent, and Separatism in the English Church is
this,&mdash;of giving to the Scriptures sole authority, especially over matters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
which the Church claimed control and jurisdiction. There was in the earlier
stage of the struggle little, if any, discordance as to doctrine. Discipline
and ritual were the matters in controversy. The rule and text of
Scripture were to displace canon law and the Church courts. The first representatives
of the sect of Baptists resolved, “by the grace of God, not
to receive or practise any piece of positive worship which had not precept
or example in the Word.”<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Nor were the Baptists in this respect
singular or emphatic beyond any others of the Dissenting company.
None of them had any misgiving as to the resources and sole authority
of Scripture to furnish them with model, guide, and rule. It is remarkable
that in view of the positive and reiterated avowal of this principle
by all the Puritans, there should have been in recent times, as there was
not in the first era of the controversy, any misapprehension of their frank
adoption of it, their resolute standing by it. Archbishop Whately repeatedly
marked it as evidence of the inspired wisdom of the New Testament
writers, that they do not define the form or pattern of a church institution
for government, worship, or discipline. The Puritans, however, believed
that those writers did this very thing, and had a purpose in doing
it. It was to strike at the very roots of this exclusive Scriptural theory
of the Puritans that Hooker wrought out his famous and noble classical
production, <i>The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</i>. He admitted in this elegant
and elaborate work that Scripture furnished the sole rule for doctrine,
but argued with consummate ability that it was not such an exclusive
and sufficient guide for government or discipline. The apostles did not,
he said, fix a rule for their successors. The Church was a divinely instituted
society; and, like every society, it had a full prerogative to make
laws for its government, ceremonial, and discipline. He argued that a
true Church polity must be taken not only from what the Scriptures affirm
distinctly, but also “from what the general rules and principles of Scripture
potentially contain.” Starting with his grand basis of the sanctity
and majesty of Law, as founded in natural order, he insisted that the
Church should establish such order in laws, rites, and ceremonies within
its fold, and that all who have been baptized into it are bound to conform
to its ecclesiastical laws. He would not concede to the Puritans their
position of denial, but he insisted that Episcopacy was of apostolic institution.
He was, however, at fault in affirming that the Puritans admitted
that they could not find all the parts of the discipline which they stood
for in the Scriptures. Dean Stanley comes nearer to the truth, in what
is for him a sharp judgment, when he writes: “The Puritan idea that
there was a Biblical counterpart to every&mdash;the most trivial&mdash;incident or
institution of modern ecclesiastical life, has met with an unsparing criticism
from the hand of Hooker.”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Indeed, it was keenly argued as against
these Puritan sticklers for adhesion to Scripture rule and model, that they
by no means conformed rigidly to the pattern, as they dropped from observance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
such matters as a community of goods, the love feast, the kiss of peace,
the Lord’s Supper in upper chambers, and baptism by immersion.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, to this attempt of all Nonconformists to make the Scriptures
the sole and rigid guide alike in Church discipline as in doctrine, that we
are to trace their divergencies and dissensions among themselves, their
heated controversies, their discordant factions, their constant parting up of
their small conventicles into smaller ones, even of only two or three members,
and the real origin of all modern sects. This was the common experience
of such Dissenters from the Church, alike in England before their
exile and then in all the places of their exile,&mdash;Holland, Frankfort, Geneva,
and elsewhere. It could not but follow on their keen, acute, and concentrated
searching and scanning of every sentence and word of Scripture as
bearing upon their contest with prelacy, that they should be led beyond
matters of mere discipline into those of doctrine. A very small point was
enough to open a new issue. It is vexing to the spirit, while winning sometimes
our admiration for the intense and awful sincerity of the self-inflicting
victims of their own scruples, magnified into compunctions of conscience,
to trace the quarrels and leave-takings of those poor exiles on the Continent,
struggling in toil and sacrifice for a bare subsistence, but finding compensation
if not solace in their endless and ever-sharpening altercations. But
while all this saddens and oppresses us, we have to allow that it was natural
and inevitable. The Bible, the Holy Scriptures, will never henceforward to
any generation, in any part of the globe, be, or stand for, to individuals or
groups of men and women, what it was to the early English Puritans. To it
was intrusted all the honor, reverence, obedience, and transcendent responsibility
in the life, the hope, and the salvation of men, which had but recently
been given, in awe and dread, to a now dishonored and repudiated Church,
against which scorn and contempt and hate could hardly enough embitter
reproach and invective. With that Book in hand, men and women, than
whom there have never lived those more earnest and sincere, sat down in
absorbed soul-devotion, to exercise their own thinking on the highest subjects,
to decide each for himself what he could make of it. Those who
have lived under a democracy, or a full civil, mental, and religious freedom
like our own, well know the crudity, the perversity, the persistency, the conceits
and idiosyncrasies into which individualism will run on civil, social,
and political matters of private and public interest. How much more then
will all exorbitant and eccentric, as well as all ingenious and rational, manifestations
of like sort present themselves, when, instead of dealing with
ballots, fashions, and social issues, men and women take in hand a book
which, so to speak, they have just seized out of a descending cloud, as from
the very hand of God. It was easy to claim the right of private judgment;
but to learn how wisely to use it was quite a different matter. It was, however,
in those earnest, keen studies, those brooding musings, those searching
and subtle processes of speculation and dialectic argument engaged upon
the Bible and upon institutional religion, that the wit, the wisdom, the logic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and the vigor of the understanding powers of people of the English race
were sharpened to an edge and a toughness known elsewhere in no other.
The aim of Prelatists, Conformists, and clerical and civil magistrates in
religion, to bring all into a common belief and ritual, was hopeless from the
start. It made no allowance for the rooted varieties and divergencies in
nature, taste, sensibility, judgment, and conscience in individuals who were
anything more than animated clods. How was it possible for one born and
furnished in the inner man to be a Quaker, to be manufactured into a
Churchman? It soon became very evident that bringing such a people
as the English into accord in belief and observance under a hierarchical
and parochial system would be no work of dictation or persuasion, but
would require authority, force, penalties touching spiritual, mental, and
bodily freedom, and resorting to fines, violence, and prisons.</p>

<p>The consumptive boy-king, Edward VI., dying when sixteen years of
age, through his advisers, advanced the Reformation in some of its details
beyond the stage at which it was left by his father, and put the work in
the direction of further progress. But “Bloody Mary,” with her spectral
Spanish consort, Philip II., overset what had by no means become a Protestant
realm, and made it over to cardinal and pope. Nearly three hundred
martyrs, including an archbishop and four bishops, perished at the
stake, besides the uncounted victims in the dungeons. No one had
suffered to the death for religion in the preceding reign. After her
accession, Elizabeth stiffly held back from accepting even that stage of
reform reached by Edward. In the Convocation of 1562, only a single
vote, on a division, withstood the proposal to clear the ritual of nearly
every ceremony objectionable to the Puritans. The two statutes of supremacy
and uniformity, passed in the first year of the reign of Elizabeth,
brought the English Church under that subjection to the temporal or
civil jurisdiction which has continued to this day. The firmness, not to
say the obstinacy, with which the Queen stood for her prerogative in this
matter has been entailed upon Parliament; and the ecclesiastical Convocation
has in vain struggled to assert independency of it. Elizabeth exhibited
about an equal measure of zeal against Catholics and Puritans.
She frankly gave out her resolution that if she should marry a Catholic
prince, she should not allow him a private chapel in her palace. About
two hundred Catholics suffered death in her reign.</p>

<p>An important episode in the development of Puritanism and Separatism
in the English Church brings to our notice the share which different parties
came to have in both those forms of dissent during a period of temporary
exile on the Continent in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Mary, and afterward
of Elizabeth. The results reached by the two classes of those exiles
were manifested respectively in the colonization, first by Separatists, at Plymouth,
and next by Nonconformists in the Massachusetts Bay, and by other
New England colonists.</p>

<p>In the thirty-first year of Henry’s reign, 1539, while the monarch was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
vacillating between the old religion and the new, was enacted what was
called “The Bloody Statute.” This was of “six articles.” These articles
enforced the dogmas of Transubstantiation, of Communion in One Element,
of the Celibacy of the Clergy, of the Vows of Chastity, of Private
Masses, and of Auricular Confession. An infraction of these articles in
act or speech or writing was to be punished either by burning, as heresy,
or by execution, as felony. The articles were to be publicly read by all
the clergy quarterly. To escape the operation of this statute, many of the
clergy went to Geneva. Returning on the accession of Edward, they had to
exile themselves again when Mary came to the throne, to venture home once
more under Elizabeth, in 1559. As early as 1528, there had been a small
but earnest religious fellowship of devout scholars in Cambridge, meeting
for exercises of prayer and reading. Three of its members&mdash;Bilney,
Latimer, and Bradford&mdash;were burned under Mary. Afterward Travers and
Cartwright, both of them men of eminent ability and religious fervor, had
found refuge in Geneva; and to them, on their return, is to be ascribed
the strength and prevalence of the spirit of Puritanism in Cambridge.
The fact that so many men of parts and scholarship and distinguished
position were thus principal agents in the first working of Puritanism,
should qualify the common notion that Nonconformity in England had
its rise through obscure and ordinary men. Some of the most eminent
Puritans, and even Separatists, were noted university men and scholars,&mdash;like
Cartwright, Perkins, Ames, Bradshaw, and Jacob, the last being of
Oxford. Robinson, the pastor at Leyden, has been pronounced to have
been among the first men of his time in learning and comprehensiveness
of mind.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> It was really in the churches of the English exiles in Holland
that the ultimate principles of Independency and Congregationalism
were wrought out, to be asserted and so manfully stood for both in Old
and in New England. Indeed, the essential principles of largest toleration
and of equality, save in civil functions, had been established in Holland
in 1572, before the coming of the English exiles. Almost as real as
ideal was the recognition there of the one all-comprehensive church represented
by a multitude of independent elements. Greenwood and his
fellow-student at Cambridge,&mdash;Barrow, a layman,&mdash;joined the Separatists
in 1586. The Separatists in England might well, as they did, complain
to King James that he did not allow the same liberty to them, his own
subjects, as was enjoyed by the French and Walloon churches in London
and elsewhere in England.</p>

<p>On the accession of Queen Mary, who was crowned in 1553, more than
eight hundred of the English Reformers took refuge on the Continent.
Among them were five bishops, five deans, four archdeacons, fifty doctors
of divinity and famous preachers, with nobles, merchants, traders, mechanics,
etc. Among the “sundrie godly men” who went to Frankfort,
the Lutheran system gained much influence. Those who found a refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in Zurich and Geneva were more affected towards the Calvinistic. Soon
after a flourishing and harmonious church, with the favor of the magistrates,
had been established at Frankfort, dissension about matters of discipline
and the use of the Prayer-book of King Edward VI., with or without a
revision, was opened by some new-comers. The advice of Knox, Calvin,
and others, which was asked, did not prevent an acrimonious strife, which
ended in division.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Carrying back their differences to England, we find
them contributing to deepen the alienation and the variances between Conformists,
Nonconformists, and Separatists. The intimacy and sympathy
with Reformers on the Continent naturally induced the exiles, even the
English bishops who had been among them, to lay but little stress on the
exclusive prerogatives of Episcopacy, including the theory of Apostolic
Succession.</p>

<p>The English bishops who were most earnest in the early measures
of reform,&mdash;such as Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer,&mdash;realizing that in the
minds of the common people the strong ties of association connected with
the emblems, forms, and vestments of the repudiated Church of Rome
would encourage lingering superstitions in their continued use, would have
had them wholly set aside. Especially would they have had substituted in
the chancels of churches tables instead of altars, as the latter would always
be identified with the Mass. The people also associated the validity of
clerical administrations with priestly garments. The starting point of the
Puritan agitation and protest as to these matters may well be found, therefore,
in the refusal of Dr. Hooper to wear the clerical vestments for his
consecration as Bishop of Gloucester in 1550. Having exiled himself at
Zurich during the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII., Hooper had
become more thoroughly imbued with Reforming principles, and withstood
the compromising compliances which some of the Continental Reformers
yielded. Even Ridley insisted upon his putting on the vestments for his
consecration; and after being imprisoned for his recusancy, he was forced
to a partial concession. This matter of habits, tippets, caps, etc., may be
viewed either as a bugbear, or as representative of a very serious principle.</p>

<p>In an early stage of the Puritan movement as working in the progress of
the Reformation in England, it thus appeared that what, as represented in
men and principles, might be called a third party, was to assert itself. As
the event proved, in the struggle for the years following, and in the accomplished
result still triumphant, this third party was to hold the balance of
power. There was a general accord in dispensing with the Pope, renouncing
his sway, and retaining within the realm the exercise of all ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
jurisdiction. A Romanizing party was still in strength, with its
hopes temporarily reviving, its agencies, open and secret, on the alert, and
its threats bold, if opportunity should favor the execution of them. This
Romanizing faction may represent one extreme; the Puritans may represent
another. A third, and for a considerable space of time weaker, as
already stated, than either of them, intervened, to win at last the victory.
In ridding themselves of Rome, the Puritans aimed to rid the Church of
everything that had come into it from that source,&mdash;hierarchy, ceremonial,
superstition, discipline, and assumption of ecclesiastical prerogative,&mdash;reducing
the whole Church fabric to what they called gospel
simplicity in rule and order; the apostolic model. This, as we have
noticed, was to be sought full, sufficient, and authoritative in the Scriptures.
But neither of the Reforming monarchs, nor the majority of the
prelates successively exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction, were prepared
for this reversion to so-called first principles. They would not allow
the sufficiency nor the sole authority of the Scriptural model; nor
would they admit that all that was wrought into the hierarchy, the ceremonial,
the institution, and the discipline of the English Church came
into it through Popery, and had the taint or blemish of Popery. The
English Church now represents the principles then argued out, maintained,
and adopted. It followed a principle of selection, sometimes
called compromise, to some seeming arbitrary, to others reasonable and
right. It proceeded upon the recognition of an interval between the close
of the ministry of the apostles and the rise of the Papacy, with its superstitious
innovations and impositions, during which certain principles and
usages in the government and ceremonial of the Church came into observance.
Though these might not have the express warrant of Scripture,
they were in nowise inconsistent with Scripture. They might claim to
have the real warrant and approval of the apostles, because they were
“primitive,” and might even be regarded as essential, as Hooker so
earnestly tried to show, to the good order, dignity, and efficiency of the
Church of Christ. With exceeding ability did the Puritan and the Church
parties deal with this vital issue. The Puritans brought to it no less of
keen acumen, learning, and logic than did their opponents. They thoroughly
comprehended what the controversy involved. When, fifty years
ago, substantially the same issue was under vigorous discussion in the
Oxford or Tractarian agitation, so far were the “Puseyites,” so-called,
from bringing into it any new matter, that the old arsenal was drawn
upon largely for fresh use.</p>

<p>The Puritans held loyally to the fundamental position asserted by their
sturdy champion. Cartwright, in his <i>Admonition</i>, etc.,&mdash;“The discipline of
Christ’s Church that is necessary for all time is delivered by Christ, and
set down in the Holy Scripture.” The objection, fatal in the eyes of the
Puritans, to receiving, as authoritative, customs and vouchers of the so-called
“Primitive” Church and of the Fathers, was that it compelled to the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of a sort of eclecticism in choosing or rejecting, by individual preference or
judgment, out of that mass of heterogeneous gathering which Milton scornfully
described as “the drag-net of antiquity.” Though the pleaders on
both sides of the controversy succeeded in showing that “patristic” authority,
and the usages and institutions which might be traced out and
verified in the dim past, were by no means in accord or harmony as to
what was “primitive,” both parties seem to have consented to hide, gloss
over, or palliate very much of the crudity, folly, superstition, conceit, and
discordancy so abounding in the writings of the Fathers. Nothing could
be more positive than the teaching of St. Augustine,&mdash;not drawn from the
New Testament, in which the rite was for adults, but from the then universal
practice of the Church,&mdash;that baptism was to be for infants, and by
immersion. That Father taught that an unbaptized infant is forever lost;
and that, besides baptism, the infant’s salvation depends upon its receiving
the Eucharist. Yet this has not hindered but that the vast majority of
Christians, Roman Catholic and Protestant, save a single sect, administer
the rite by sprinkling infants. How, too, could the Prelatists approve a
quotation from Tertullian:<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> “Where there are only three, and they laics,
there is a church”?</p>

<p>In consistency with this their vital principle of the sole sufficiency of
the Scripture institution and pattern for a church, the work of purification
led its resolute asserters to press their protests and demands against not
only such superstitions and innovations as could be traced directly to the
Roman corruption and innovation, but to a more thorough expurgation.
Incident to the rupture with the Papacy, and in the purpose to repel
what seemed to be its vengeful and spiteful devices for recovering its
sway, there was developed among the most impassioned of the Reformers
an intense and scornful hate, a bitter heaping of invectives, objurgations,
and all-wrathful epithets against the old Church as simply blasphemous,&mdash;the
personification of Antichrist. So they were resolute to rid themselves
of all “the marks of the Beast.” The scrapings, rags, tatters of Popery,
and everything left of such remnants, especially provoked their contempt.
Having adopted the conviction that the “Mass” was an idolatrous performance,
all its paraphernalia, associated in the minds of the common
people with it as a magical rite, the priestly and altar habits, the cap,
the tippet, the rochet, etc., were denounced and condemned. The very
word “priest,” with all the functionary and mediatorial offices going with
it, was repudiated. The New Testament knew only of ministers, pastors,
teachers. While, of course, recognizing that the apostles exercised special
and peculiar prerogatives in planting the Church, the Puritans maintained
that they had no successors in their full authority. The Christian Church
assembly they found to be based upon and started from the Synagogue,
with its free, popular methods, and not upon the Temple, with its altar,
priests, and ritual. It is an interesting and significant fact, that while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the Reformation in its ferment was working as if all the elements of
Church institution were perfectly free for new combinations, the edition
of the English Bible called Cranmer’s, in 1539, translated the word <i>ecclesia</i>
by “congregation,” not “church,”&mdash;thus providing for that Puritan principle
of the province of the laity. Doctrine, discipline, and ritual, or
ceremony, being the natural order in which ecclesiastical affairs should
receive regard, there being at first an accord among the Reformers as
to doctrine, the other essentials engrossed all minds. The equality of the
ministers of religion, all of whom were brethren, with no longer a master
upon earth, struck at the very roots of all hierarchical order. What
would have been simply natural in the objections of the Puritans when
they saw that Rome was to leave the prelatical element of its system
fastened upon the realm, was intensified by the assumption of dangerous
and, as they believed, unchristian and unscriptural power and sway by
a class of the clergy of lordly rank exercising functions in Church and
State, and taking titles from their baronial tenure of land. These lordly
prelates had recently been filling some of the highest administrative and
executive offices under the Crown, and holding places in diplomacy. In
an early stage of the Reformation, the mitred abbots had been dropped
out of the upper house of Parliament. While they were in it, they, with
the twenty-one “Lord Bishops,” preponderated over the temporal peers. As
their exclusion weakened the ecclesiastical power in the government, the
prelates who remained seemed to believe and to act as if it fell to them to
represent and exercise the full prerogative of sway which had belonged to
the old hierarchy. Very marked is the new phase assumed by the spirit
and course of the Nonconformists under this changed aspect of the controversy.
The Puritans had begun by objecting and protesting against certain
usages; they now set themselves resolutely against the authority of those
who enforced such usages. To a great extent, the Roman Catholic prelates
on those parts of the Continent where the Reformation established
itself, deserted their sees. This left the way clear in those places for a
church polity independent of prelacy. The retention of their sees and
functions by the English bishops, and the addition to their number by
the consecration of others as selected by the Crown, thus made the
struggle which the Puritans maintained in England quite unlike that of
their sympathizers on the Continent. The issue thus raised on the single
question of the Divine right and the apostolic authority and succession
of bishops was continuously in agitation through the whole contention
maintained by Dissenters. In other elements of it, the controversy exhibited
changing phases, as the process of the reform seemed at intervals
to be advanced or impeded, while the kingdom, as we have noted, was
pulsating between the old and the new <i>régime</i>,&mdash;as Henry VIII. and
his three children, in their succession to his throne, sought to modify,
to arrest, or to limit it. The distribution among the people of the
Scriptures in the English tongue was favored and brought about by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Thomas Cromwell and Cranmer. The privilege, however, was soon revoked,
as the people were thus helped to take the matter of religion
into their own hands. The mother tongue was first used in worship
with the translated litany in 1542, which was revised in 1549. The new
prayer-book, canons, and homilies were brought into use. It was by
royal authority, and not either by Convocation or Parliament, that the
Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion were imposed. On Elizabeth’s accession
there were nine thousand four hundred priests in England. About two
hundred of these abandoned their posts rather than comply with the
conditions exacted by the stage in innovation already reached. The
more pronounced champions of the Church of England are earnest in
pleading that the rupture with Rome was not the act of the King, but
of what might be called the Church itself. The as yet unreformed
bishops, we are told, had in Convocation, in 1531, denied the Papal supremacy;
then Parliament, the universities, the cathedral bodies, and the
monastic societies had confirmed the denial. But on all these points
there are still open and contested questions of fact and argument not
requiring discussion here.</p>

<p>Another radical question concerned the rights and province of the laity
in all that entered into the institutional part of religion, and the oversight
and administration of discipline in religious assemblies. There certainly
could be no complaint that lay or civil power as represented by the monarch
had not exhibited sufficient potency in fettering the ecclesiastical
or clerical usurpation. An already quoted Act in the twenty-sixth year of
Henry’s reign affirmed that “whatsoever his Majesty should enjoin in
matters of religion should be obeyed by all his subjects.” The Acts of
Supremacy and Uniformity in the first year of Elizabeth made the Church
subordinate to, and dependent upon, the civil power. Thus ecclesiastical
authority was restrained by the prerogative of the Crown, while ceremonial
and discipline, as approved by the monarch, were left at the dictation of
Parliament.</p>

<p>But this substitution of the lay power as represented by King or Queen
and the Houses of Parliament for the Papal sway, by no means satisfied the
Puritan idea and conviction as to the rightful claims of the laity in their
membership of the reconstructed Church. Barrow described in the following
sharp sentence the summary way of proceeding so far as the laity were
concerned: “All these people, with all their manners, were in one day,
with the blast of Queen Elizabeth’s trumpet, of ignorant Papists and gross
idolaters, made faithful Christians and true professors.” It was said that the
people, divided and classed in local territorial parishes, were there treated
like sheep in folds. Illiterate, debauched, incompetent, “dumb” ministers
or priests assumed the pastorate in a most promiscuous way over these
flocks. Membership in the Church came through infancy in baptism. The
Puritans wished to sort out the draught of the Gospel net, which gathered
of every kind. They claimed that the laity should themselves be parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
in the administration of religion, in testing and approving discipline. They
believed, too, that ministers should be supported by their congregations,
and that the tithes and the landed privileges of the clergy were bribes
and lures to them, making them independent and autocratical. Church
lands and endowments, they insisted, should be sequestered, as had been
the abbeys, nunneries, and monasteries. As soon as Separatist assemblies
were associated in England or among the exiles on the Continent,
altercations and divisions occurred among them as to the functions and
the powers of the eldership, the responsibility and the authority of pastor
and covenanted members in discipline.</p>

<p>Our space will admit here of only a brief recognition, conformed however
to its slight intrinsic importance, of an element entering into the
Puritan agitation, which at the time introduced into it a glow of excitement
and a marvellously effective engagement of popular sympathy. The controversy
between the Puritans and the Prelatists had in the main been
pursued, however passionately, yet in a most grave and serious spirit, with
a profound sense of the dignity and solemnity of its themes and interests.
But from the time and occasion when Aristophanes tossed the grotesque
trifling of his <i>Clouds</i> around the sage and lofty Socrates, down to this day,
when Mr. Punch finds a weekly condiment of mischief and fun for the
people of England in their own doings and in their treatment by their governors,
it would seem as if no subject of human interest, however exalted
its moment, could escape the test of satire, sarcasm, and caricature. Experimental
ventures of this sort are naturally ephemeral, but they concentrate
their venom or their disdain upon their shrinking victims. Some of
Ben Jonson’s plays and Butler’s <i>Hudibras</i> have now alone a currency, and
that a by no means extended one, out of a vast mass of the printed ridicule
which was turned upon the Puritans. But the matter now in hand is
the skill and jollity with which one or more Puritans, with the gift of the
comic in his stern make-up, plied that keen blade in his own cause. Erasmus,
though he never broke from the communion of the Papal Church, engaged
the most stinging power of satire and sarcasm, not only against mean
and humble monks, but against all the ranks of the hierarchy, not sparing
the loftiest. Helped out with Holbein’s cuts, Erasmus’s <i>Encomium of Folly</i>
drew roars of mirth and glee from those who winced under its mocking
exposures. Even the grave Beza, in Geneva, tried his hand in this trifling.
But the venture of this sort which cunningly and adroitly intruded itself at
a peculiarly critical phase of the Puritan agitation, was of the most daring
and rasping character. Under the happily chosen pseudonym of “Martin
Mar-Prelate,” there appeared in rapid succession, during seven months of
the years 1588 and 1589, the same number of little, rudely printed tracts,
the products of ambulatory presses, which engaged the full power of satire,
caricature, and sarcasm, with fun and rollicking, invective and bitter reproach
and exposure against the hierarchy, especially against four of the
most odious of the bishops. The daring spirit of these productions was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
well matched by the devices of caution and secrecy under which they were
put in print, and in the sly methods by which they were circulated, to be
caught up, concealed, and revelled over by thousands who would find
keen enjoyment in them, as in the partaking of the sweets of stolen food
and waters. They may be said to have stopped only at the very edge of
ribaldry, indecency, and even blasphemy. But they were free and trenchant,
coarse and virulent. As such, they testify to the smart under the
provocation of which they were written, and to the scorn and contempt
entertained for the men and measures to which were committed for the
time the transcendent interests of religion and piety. The more dignified
and serious of the Puritans, like Greenham and Cartwright, frowned upon
and repudiated these weapons of bitter gibe and contumely. But there
was a constituency from which they received the heartiest welcome, and,
as is usual in such cases, their circulation and efficiency were vastly multiplied
by equally bitter and malignant replies to them from the pens or
from the instigation of bishops. The whole detective force of the kingdom
was put on the search for the writers and the printers. So adroit
and cunning was the secret of their authorship and production at the
time, that up to this day it has not been positively disclosed. Never has
the investigation been so keenly or intelligently pressed for clearing the
mystery investing the Martin Mar-Prelate tracts as by the indefatigable
researches and the sharpened inquisition of Dr. Dexter. In his <i>Congregationalism</i>
he gives his readers an exhaustive sketch and summary, in
detail and analysis, of all the facts and documents. His conclusion,
which cannot be hopefully contested or invalidated, is that they were
written by Barrow, a prisoner in the Fleet, and carried through the press
by the agency of Penry. There is abundant evidence in the appearance,
publication, and circulation of tracts known to have come from the hands
of imprisoned Puritans, that the bars of jails and dungeons offered no
sufficient barriers to prevent the secret intercourse and interchange of intelligence
between those whom they enclosed and friends outside, who
dared all risks in their zeal and fidelity.</p>

<p class="p2">We must now close this narration of the issues raised in the Puritan
controversy, whether by Nonconformists in the Church or by Separatists
withdrawing from it, that we may note the concentration of forces and witnesses
which were drawn together in assemblies or fellowships prepared in
Old England to transfer and establish their principles in New England.
Many of the clergy whose views and sympathies were warmly engaged in
the further work of reform and purification within the Church, and who at
the same time were moderate and conciliatory in their spirit, contrived to
remain in their parochial fields, perhaps in this way accomplishing the most
for all that was reasonable and good in the cause which they had at heart.
When occasionally molested or challenged, they might contrive to make
their peace. But the crisis and its demands called&mdash;as has always been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
case in such intense agitations of religious passions&mdash;for patient, steadfast,
and resolute witnesses in suffering, for those who should be hounded and
tracked by judicial processes, who should be deprived of subsistence and
liberty, and be ready not only for being hidden away in prisons or exiled
beyond the seas, but for public execution as martyrs. The emergency of
time and occasion found such as these; and it was of such as these that
there were men and women in training for wilderness work on this soil.
And the combination of materials and persons was precisely such as would
meet the exactions of such an enterprise. There were university men,
scholars, doctors in divinity, practised disputants in their cherished lore,
and with gifts of zeal, fervor, and tender eloquence in discourse and
prayer. There were gentry likewise,&mdash;men and women lifted in the social
scale, with furnishings of mind and worldly goods. To these were joined,
in a fellowship which equalized many distinctions, yeomen, small traders,
artisans, and some of every place and grade, save the low or mean or reckless,
in the make-up of the population of the realm. Governor Bradford
says that the first Separatist or Independent Church in England was that
of which John Rough, the minister, and Cuthbert Symson, the deacon,
were burned alive by Bonner, in the reign of Queen Mary. The laborious
and faithful pages of Dr. Dexter, in his <i>Congregationalism</i>, must be closely
studied for the results of the marvellous diligence and keen research by
which he has traced every vestige, memorial, and testimony that can throw
light on the little assemblies of those outlawed Puritans. It is a curious
and engaging occupation in our peaceful and lethargic times of religious
ease, to scan the make-up, the spirit, and methods of those humble assemblies
in their lurking-places, private houses, barns, or the open fields, frequently
changing their appointments under risks from spies and tipstaves,
with their secret code of signals for communicating intelligence. Their
religious exercises were of the intensest earnestness, and above all things
stimulating. Their conferences about order and discipline bristled with
individualisms and scruples. Many of these assemblies might soon resolve
themselves into constituencies of single members. There was scarce one
of those assemblies, either in England or in exile on the Continent, that
did not part into two or three. There was a stern necessity which compelled
variance and dissension among the members. They had in hand
the Bible, and each was trying what he could draw out of it, as an oracle
and a rule. They had to devise, discuss, and if possible agree upon and
enforce ways of church order and discipline, a form of worship, rules of
initiation into church membership, of suspension, expulsion, and restoration.
It was brain work, heart work, and soul work with them. It would
be difficult to reduce to any exact statements the numbers of persons, or
even of what may in a loose sense be called assemblies, of Nonconformists
or Separatists who remained in England, or who were in refuge on the
Continent at the period just preceding the colonization of New England.
What was called the Millenary Petition, which was presented to James I.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
as he came in from Scotland, was claimed to represent at least eight
hundred Nonconforming ministers.</p>

<p>The way is now open for connecting the principles and fortunes of
the earnest and proscribed class of religious men, whose course has been
thus traced in England and Holland, with the enterprise of colonization
in New England. It is but reasonable to suppose that, dating from the
time and the incident referred to in the opening of this chapter, such an
enterprise was latent in conception or desire in the thoughts of many
as a possible alternative for the near future. A resolve or purpose or
effort of such a nature as this involves much brooding over by individuals,
much private communing, balancing of circumstances, conditions,
gains, and losses, and an estimate of means and resources, with an eye
towards allowance by a governmental or noble patronage, or at least to
security in the venture. We have but fragmentary and scattered information
as to all these preliminaries to the emigration. We must trace them
backward from the completion to the initiation of the enterprise.</p>

<p>And here is the point at which we should define to ourselves, as intelligently
and fairly as we can from our abounding authentic sources of
information, precisely what was the influence or agency of religion in the
first emigration to New England. We are familiar with the oft-reiterated
and positive statement, that the enterprise would neither have been undertaken,
nor persisted in, nor led on to success, had not religion furnished
its mainspring, its guiding motive, and the end aimed at, to be in degree
realized.</p>

<p>We may safely commit ourselves to these assertions, that religion was
the master-motive and object of the most earnest and ablest leaders of the
emigration; that they felt this motive more deeply and with more of singleness
of purpose than they always avowed, as their circumstances compelled
them to take into view sublunary objects of trade and subsistence which
would engage to them needful help and resources; and that some of these
secondary objects very soon qualified and impaired the paramount importance
of the primary one. I am led to make this allowance of exception as
to the occasional reserve in the avowal of an exclusively religious motive,
because of a fact which must impress the careful student of their history
and fortunes for the first hundred years. That fact is, that in multitudes
of occasional utterances, sermons, journals, and historical sketches, many
of the descendants of the first comers laid more exclusive and emphatic
stress upon the prime agency of religion in the enterprise than did the first
movers in it. When ministers and magistrates in after years uttered their
frequent and sombre laments over the degeneracy of the times, the decay
of zeal and godliness, and the falling from the first love, the refrain always
was found in extolling the one, single, supreme aim of the fathers as that
of pure piety. The pages of Cotton Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> and of his tracts
of memorial, rebuke, and exhortation, and the <i>Century Sermon</i> of Foxcroft,
minister of the First Church, are specimens of masses of such matter in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
old cabinets pitched in that tone. Nor need we conclude that, as a general
rule, the most fervent of those laments or the most positive of those statements
were exaggerated. Only what such writers and speakers recognized
as the degeneracy of their own later times, must be traced to seeds and
agencies which came in with the most select fellowship of the fathers
themselves. We cannot go so far as to claim that the whole aim, the
all-including purpose of every member, or of even of a majority of the
colonists, was religion, after the pattern of that of the leaders, or of any
style of religion. But we have to conclude that the smaller the number
of those among whom we concentrate the religious fervor in its supreme
sway, the more intensified must have been its power to have enabled them,
as it did, to give direction to the whole enterprise. And this was not only
true at the first, but proportionately so as the original centre of that enterprise
for a long period sent off its radii successively to new settlements in
the woods. There were always found men and women enough to copy the
original pattern and to keep the motive force in action. Sir Henry Maine
does not state the whole of the truth when he writes thus: “The earliest
English emigrants to North America, who belonged principally to the class
of yeomanry, organized themselves in village communities for purposes of
cultivation.”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The stream of exile to New England in the interest of religion was first
parted into one small and one large rill, which, however, soon flowed together
and assimilated, as it appeared that they started substantially from
the same source, with similar elements, and found more that was congenial
than discordant in their qualities. The company of exiles whom residence
in Holland, with its attendant influences and results, had confirmed and
stiffened in their original principles of rigid Separatism, had the start by
nearly a decade of years in transferring themselves to Plymouth. Their
fortunes are traced in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The colonists in Massachusetts Bay, and those who, in substantial
accord with them, struck into several other settlements in the wilderness
of New England, were mainly those who in the land of their birth had
remained steadfast to their principles of Nonconformity, and who had
borne the penalties of them when avowed and put in practice. They
had not turned in disdain and temper from the institution which they
called their “mother church.” Their divided relation to it they regarded
as rather caused by such harsh conditions as excluded them from its
privileges than by any wilfulness or hostility of their own. They professed
that they still clung to its breast, and wished to be nourished
from it. It was not strange, however, that partial alienation should, under
favoring opportunities, widen and stiffen into seeming antagonism to it.
They regarded themselves as having been subjected to pains and penalties
because of their protest against objectionable and harmful, as well
as unscriptural, exactions in its discipline and ceremonial. So they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
content to be known as Nonconformists, but repelled the charge of being
Separatists. They kept alive a lingering tenderness, in a reminder of
their early membership and later disturbed affiliation with it. Some few
of the sterner spirits among them&mdash;and Roger Williams was such, as he
appeared here in his youth&mdash;demanded a penitential avowal of sin from
Winthrop’s company, on account of their having once been in fellowship
with the English Church. An agitation also arose upon the question
whether the members of the Boston Church, who on visits to the old
home occasionally conformed, should not be put under discipline on
their return here. Happily the dispute was disposed of by forbearance
and charity.</p>

<p>Still, while there was a slight manifestation at first of an antipathy or
a jealousy on the part of the Nonconformists at the Bay of being in any
way confounded with the Separatists at Plymouth, there never was a breach
or even a controversy, beyond that of a friendly discussion, between them;
and there is something well-nigh amusing, as well as interesting, in following
the quaint narration<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> of the establishment of immediate harmony and
accord between their respective church ways. Endicott’s little company
at Salem, heralding the great emigration to the Bay, “entered into church
estate” in August, 1629, having sought what we should now call the advice,
help, and sympathy of their Plymouth brethren. This fellowship was extended
through Governor Bradford and other delegates, and the example
was afterward followed in like recognition of other churches. The covenanted
members of the Salem Church <i>ordained</i> their pastor and teacher,
notwithstanding that they had previously been under the hands of a bishop.
It soon appeared, however, that the church was to be emphatically Nonconformist.
Two brothers Brown, at Salem, set up separate worship by the
Common Prayer. On being “convented” before the Governor, his Council
and the ministers, and accusing the church of Separatism, they were told
that the members did not wish to be Separatists, but were simply Nonconformists
with the corruptions of the Church; and that having suffered
much for their principles, and being now in a free place, they were determined
to be rid of Common Prayer and ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The First Boston Church, in 1630, was organized under its covenant, with
its appointed and ordained teacher, ruling elder, and deacons. In ten years
after the landing at Plymouth there were five churches after this pattern,
and in twenty years thirty-five, in New England.</p>

<p>This instantaneous abandonment, as it may be called, of everything in
the institution of a church, followed by an immediate disuse of everything
in ceremonial and worship in the English usage which the Nonconformists
had scrupled at home, is of itself very suggestive, even in the first aspect
of it. Followed into detail, it presents some surprises and very rich instruction.
In full result, it exhibits to us principles and institutions in the highest
interests of religion, in civil, social, and domestic life, which had been repudiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and put under severe penalties in England, crossing the ocean to
plant themselves in a wilderness for the training and guidance of successive
generations of men and women in freedom, virtue, piety, worldly thrift, and
every form of prosperity. There must have been nobleness in those principles,
as well as in the men and women who suffered for them, put them on
trial, and led them to triumph.</p>

<p>The work of preference, of conviction and conscience, had been wrought
in behalf of those principles, in old English homes and byways, in humble
conventicles, in fireside and wayside musings and conferences. Enough
persons had been brought to be of one mind, purpose, and resolve, in
the spirit of a determined heroism, to make a beginning of such a sort
that it would be more than half of the accomplished work. There may
have been debates, warm variances, hesitations, and conciliatory methods
used among those who entered into covenant as the First Church of Boston.
If there were such, we know nothing of them. There is no surviving
record or intimation of them. The pattern and model which the
exiled colonists followed, needed no study or shaping on the wilderness soil.
It was an old-home product. What might seem to be extemporized work
was prepared work. It was as if they had brought over timbers cut in their
native woods all framed and matched for setting up in their transferred
home. Their initiated teachers had been ordained by Episcopal hands.
But this was neither help nor hindrance. When they needed more and new
ones, they had a method of qualifying them. Surplice, tippet, cap, rochet,
and prayer-book are not missed or mourned over. Simply not a word is
said about them. The fabric which they set up was of a new and peculiar
style. No! They would not have owned it to be new; they regarded it as
the oldest, because the original,&mdash;that which was established by the first
generation of the disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>One hundred university men from the grand old nooks and shrines of consecrated
learning in Old England were the medium for the “Gospel work”
in New England, till it could supply its needs from its own well-provided
resources. But there was not a prelate among them. English magistrates
of various grades and authority, governors, judges, spies, collectors, and
commissionaries were here to represent the mother country, till she became
so stingy that we were forced to wean ourselves from her; but never did an
English bishop as a functionary set foot on the soil of what is now the territory
of the United States. And when after our Revolution the virtue
which comes from episcopal hands was communicated to the possessors of
it here, it had parted with what was most offensive or objectionable in its
claim or efficacy to the Old and the New English Puritans. Town and
rural parishes, colleges and schools, had the faithful services of that hundred
of university men. For a long time, the books that were imported here
were almost exclusively the Puritan literature of the old home, and had a
perceptible influence in stiffening, rather than relaxing, the stern spirit of
Dissent, and throwing new vitality into the hard work which it had to do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the wilderness. One consideration of the highest practical weight is presented
to us in the fact that the Puritanism of New England originated and
fostered the free and radically working instrumentalities and forces which
neutralized its own errors, restrained its own bigotry and severity, and
compelled it to develop from its own best elements something better
than itself. There were other plantations on this virgin soil, of which
religion was in no sense the master-impulse, and others still in which the
mother church sought to direct the movement. New England was never
affected for evil or for good by them. But if over the whole land, in
radiations or percolations of influence, the leaven of any one section of
the country has wrought in the whole of it, it is that of the New England
Puritanism.</p>

<h3><a name="c244" id="c244">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE original authorities and sources of information, in manuscript and print, relating
to the agitations and controversies arising within the real or assumed membership
of the Church of England after the Reformation, are to be distinguished into two great
classes,&mdash;those of a public character, as records of the proceedings of government, of
the courts, and of all bodies or individuals in office charged with authority; and those of
a private nature, coming from voluntary bodies, or from single members of them, or from
writers and authors whose works were published after the usual method, or sent forth and
circulated surreptitiously. Both these classes of original authorities, constituting together
an enormous mass of an infinitely varied elementary composition, are alike widely
scattered, and, so far as they have not been gathered into local repositories, could be
directly consulted only by one whose travel, investigation, and research were of the most
extended comprehensiveness. England, Holland, and Switzerland have in keeping contemporary
records and documents relating to minute and trivial, or to most important and
vital, points in one or another stage, or concerning one or another prime party in the controversy.
Perhaps, even after all the keen investigation and diligent toil of the most
recent inquisitors, such original papers have not been exhaustively detected and examined.
But one who is familiar with the stores already reported to us, unless his taste
and interest in them run to morbidness, will hardly desire more of them. It is certain
that whatever obscurity may still invest any incidental point in the controversy, the matter
is of such comparatively slight importance, that the substance and details of any information
as to persons or events which may be lacking to us would hardly qualify the general
narratives of history.</p>

<p>The expense, diligence, and intelligent illustration which within the last thirty or forty
years have been devoted to the collection and arrangement and calendaring of such masses
of the State and other public papers of Great Britain, have aided as well as prompted the
researches of those who have been zealous to trace out with fidelity and accuracy every
stage, and the character and course of each one, lofty or obscure, as an actor in the larger
and the lesser bearings of the struggle of Nonconformity and Dissent. As a general statement,
it may be affirmed that the developments and the more full and minute information
concerning the substance and phases of early Puritanism, as they have been studied in
the mass of accumulated documents, have set forth the controversy in a dignity of interest
and in a disclosure of its vital relations to all theories of civil government, church establishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and the institutional administration of religion, far more fully and in a much
more comprehensive view than was recognized by contemporary actors.</p>

<p>There are two extensive and exceedingly rich collections of tracts, books, and manuscript
documents of a most varied character well-preserved and easily accessible in London,
which furnish well-nigh inexhaustible materials for the study of the Puritan, the
Nonconformist, and the Separatist movements in all their phases. One of these is in the
British Museum, the other in Dr. Williams’s Library. In the times with which we are
now concerned, the motive, perhaps but vaguely comprehended by himself, which led
George Thomason to gather his marvellous collection, now in the British Museum, would
have been called a <i>providential</i> prompting. He was a modest man in private life, and,
so far as we know, took no part in public agitations. As a Royalist bookseller, at “The
Rose and Crown, in St. Paul’s Churchyard,” he had opportunities favoring him in the
scheme which he undertook. It was in 1641 that he began a laborious enterprise, and
one not without very serious risks to himself, which he continued to pursue till just before
his death in 1666. This was to gather up, preserve, and bind in volumes,&mdash;though without
any system or order of arrangement except chronological,&mdash;a copy of each of the
publications in tract, or pamphlet, or fly-leaf form which appeared from the press, licensed
or surreptitiously printed, during a period teeming with the issue, like the dropping of
forest leaves, of a most extraordinary series of ephemeral works, quickened with all the
vitality of those times. Though he began his collection in 1641, he anticipated that date
by gathering similar publications previous to it. He copied during Cromwell’s time nearly
a hundred manuscripts, mainly “on the King’s side, which no man durst venture to publish
here without the danger of his ruin.” He took pains to write upon most of the
publications the date of its appearance, and when anonymous, the name of its author if
he could ascertain it. Besides the risks of fire and the burden of such a mass of materials
filling his house from cellar to garret, this zealous collector exposed himself to
severe penalties from the authorities on either side of the great civil and religious conflict.
He was compelled once at least to remove his collection to a safe hiding-place. It fills
now 2,220 volumes, and counts to 34,000 separate publications, from folio downward. It
is difficult to say what may not be found there, and nearly as difficult to find exactly what
one wishes. After various exposures through which the collection passed safely, it now
rests in the British Museum, under the general title of the “King’s Pamphlets,” having
been purchased and presented by King George III. in 1762, at a cost of £300. A mine
of most curious matter is there ready for search on every subject, serious or comic, sacred
or secular, illustrative of high and low life during the period. Probably the two most
zealous delvers in that mine for its best uses have been Professor Masson, for the purpose
of <i>The Life of John Milton: narrated in connexion with the Political, Ecclesiastical, and
Literary History of his Time</i>, in six volumes; and Dr. H. M. Dexter, in his <i>Congregationalism
of the Last Three Hundred Years</i>, etc. Both authors have turned these
pamphlets to the best account in clearing obscurities or filling gaps in the history or
writings of men prominent in the cause of Nonconformity.</p>

<p>The other comprehensive and extensive collection of pamphlets, volumes, and original
papers for illustrating the whole history of Puritanism and Dissent, is in what is known
as Dr. Williams’s Library, in London. Dr. Daniel Williams, an eminent Presbyterian
divine, possessed of means, had purchased the library of the famous Dr. William Bates.
Adding to it from his own resources, he founded in 1716 the library which bears his name,
committing it, with a sum of money for a building (to which additions were made by a
subscription), to the hands of trustees in succession. The library edifice&mdash;long standing
in Red-Cross Street, now removed to Grafton Street&mdash;has been ever since a favorite place
for the assembling of meetings and committees in the Dissenting interest (of late years
Presbyterians and Unitarians acceding to their trust), for the transaction of business, for
preparing addresses to successive sovereigns, and managing their cause in Parliament.
Those who in former years have sat in one of the ancient chairs of the library in Red-Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Street have hardly escaped feeling profoundly the influence of the place and of its associations,&mdash;the
walls hung with the portraits of venerable divines and scholars learned in all
ancient lore; the cabinets filled with laboriously wrought manuscripts, histories, diaries,
and letters, some of them dating in the first half of the sixteenth century; the crowded
shelves of folios and smaller tractates composed of brain-work and patient toil, without
the facilities of modern research and study, and the many relics and memorials connected
with the daily ministerial and domestic life of men of self-denying and honorable
service. Harvard College holds and administers a fund of over sixteen thousand dollars,
left by Dr. Williams in 1711, as a trust for the benefit of the aborigines.</p>

<p>Here is the fitting place for appropriate and most grateful mention of the results of a
labor of devoted zeal and love given by the Rev. Henry Martyn Dexter, D.D., to the
historic memorial of a cause of which he inherits the full spirit, and in the service of
which he has spent his mature life. It may safely be said that not a single person, at
least of those born on the soil of New England, of the lineage of the Fathers has so
“magnified” their cause and work as he has done. Holding with such a rooted conviction,
as is his, that the Congregational polity of the Christian Church has the warrant of Scripture
and of the Primitive Church, and that it best serves the sacred interests of soul-freedom
and of associated religion in its institutions, works, and influence, the earliest
witnesses, confessors, and martyrs in its behalf have seemed to him worthy of the most
lavish labor for their commemoration. Repeatedly has he crossed the seas and plied his
most diligent scrutiny of tracing and searching, as he got the scent of some tract or
record in its hiding-place of private cabinet or dim old parchment. With hardly eye or
thought for the usual attractions of foreign travel, his valuable leisure has been spent in
following any clew which promised him even the slightest aid to clearing an obscure
point, or setting right a disputed fact, or completing our information on any serious
matter relating to the early history of what is now represented by Congregationalism.
The Introduction to his volume, <i>The Congregationalism of the last Three Hundred
Years, as seen in its Literature, with Special Reference to Certain Recondite, Neglected,
or Disputed Passages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> tells in a vigorous and hearty tone what was his aim, his course,
and its method.</p>

<p>The principal text of his volume disposes the treatment of his subject under twelve
lectures, delivered by the author in the Theological Seminary at Andover, in 1876-1879.
This text is elaborately illustrated by notes, with references and extracts, largely drawn
from the recondite sources and the depositories already referred to. The author is careful
to authenticate all his statements from prime authorities; and where obscurity or conflict
of views or of evidence adduced makes it necessary, his patience and candor give weight
to his judgment or decision. The extraordinary and unique element of his work is presented
in his <i>Collections towards a Bibliography of Congregationalism</i>, which with the
Index to its titles covers more than three hundred royal octavo pages, in close type.
This contains an enumeration of 7,250 titles of publications, from folios down to a few
leaves, dating between the years 1546 and 1879, which have even the slightest relation in
contents, authorship, or purpose with the most comprehensive bearings of his subject
in its historical development.</p>

<p>I have mentioned this elaborate work among the primary, instead of classing it with
the secondary, sources of information on the history of Nonconformity, because it is
something more than a link between the two. It takes its flavor from the past. Its
abounding extracts from the quaint writings, and its portraitures and relations of the
experiences, of the old-time worthies transfer us to their presence, make us sharers of
their buffeted fortunes and listeners to their living speech. The work may be regarded
as a summary of monumental memorials, more frank and true than are such generally on
stone or brass of those who fought a good fight and trusted in promises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The natural desire of a dispassionate reader of the original documents dealing with
the heats of the Puritan controversy, or pursuing it in the pages of historians who may
relate it either with a partisan or an impartial spirit, is that he might have before him the
words and impressions of some contemporary or observer of profound wisdom and of
well-balanced judgment, as he viewed this turmoil of affairs. The nearest approach made
to the gratification of this wish is found in two brief but very comprehensive essays
from the pen of the great Lord Bacon, as with an evident serenity and poise of spirit he
studied the scenes before him, and the characters, aims, excesses, and shortcomings of
the various actors, monarchs, prelates, zealots, enthusiasts, and earnest, however ill-judging,
extremists on either side. The first of these essays in publication, whenever it
may have been written, is entitled <i>Certain Considerations touching the better Pacification
and Edification of the Church of England</i>. The date of its imprint is 1640. But in this
reference is made, in the address to King James, to an earlier essay, which appeared
anonymously with the imprint of 1641, under the title of <i>An Advertisement touching the
Controversies of the Church of England</i>. This was evidently written in the time of
Elizabeth. In it, Bacon sagaciously traces the origin of the controversy to four main
springs,&mdash;namely, the offering and the accepting occasions for variance; the extending and
multiplying them; passionate and unbrotherly proceedings on both parts, and the recourse
on either side to a stiffer union among its members, heightening the distraction. His
most severe stricture is upon the Church, for its harsh measures, as the strife advanced, in
enforcing with penalties what had previously been allowed to be matters of indifference,
thus driving some discontents into a banded sect. He regards it as a grave error that
some of the English Church zealots had spoken contemptuously of foreign Protestant
Churches. Though Bacon affirms that he is himself no party to the strife, and aims
only for an impartial arbitration in it, his judgment and sympathy evidently incline
him to the Puritan side as against the bishops. A fair-minded Puritan of the time
might well have contented himself with this wise man’s statement of his side and cause.
Of the second of these essays, it being addressed to King James on his accession, it
may be said that it would be difficult to find any piece of writing of equal compass, on
the themes with which it deals, more crowded with sound, solid good sense, better balanced
in its allowances and limitations, more moderate, judicious, and practical in its
principles, or more likely to harmonize all reasonable differences, and to repress and
discountenance extreme and perverse individualisms. Bacon justifies innovations and
reconstructions. He tells the King that the opening of his reign is the opportune time
for making them. He protests against modelling all reformation after one pattern. Then
he utters words of eminent wisdom about the government of bishops, about the liturgy,
ceremonies, and subscription, about a preaching ministry, the abuse of excommunication,
and about non-residence, pluralities, and the maintenance of the ministry. Here, again,
moderate men of both parties might well have been content with the great philosopher’s
judgment.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Documents in Foreign Repositories.</span>&mdash;In connection with the exile of so many
prelates, clergy, and other members of the English Church on the accession of Queen
Mary in 1553, the relations established between them and many eminent Reformers on the
Continent resulted in the production of a large number of documents of the highest historical
authenticity and value, as throwing light upon the aims and methods of the Puritans
in England during the whole period from 1553 to 1602. Several of these exiles settled at
Zurich, and there formed intimate friendships with many magistrates and ministers of the
Reformed religion. On the return of the exiles, on the accession of Elizabeth, many of
them kept up a constant correspondence with their friends. The letters have been preserved
in the archives of Zurich, and it has been only within the last forty years that the
wealth of information in them has been revealed in England. There are nearly two
hundred folio volumes of these letters. Strype and Burnet had obtained copies of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of them, which they put to use in their histories.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> A descendant of one of the Swiss
correspondents had before 1788 copied eighteen thousand of the letters with his own hand,
arranged chronologically. In 1845 and 1846, “The Parker Society” in England published,<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
in four octavo volumes, a large number of these “Zurich Letters,” translated and
carefully edited, with annotations. The general titles are <i>The Zurich Letters, comprising
the Correspondence of Several English Bishops, and Others, with Some of the Helvetian
Reformers</i>, during the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Queens Mary and Elizabeth.
In the collection are several letters to royal personages. One of these, by Rodolph
Gualter, who in his youth had resided at Oxford, to Queen Elizabeth, dated Zurich,
Jan. 16, 1559, is a long epistle, written in a dignified, courteous and earnest strain, counselling
the Queen to have two things in her supreme regard: “First, that every reformation
of the Church and of religion be conducted agreeably to the Word of God;” and second,
that she restrain her counsellors from hindering or reversing the good work. Better than
from the best-digested pages of history, one may learn from these fresh and admirable
letters, down to the most minute detail and incident, the cross-workings, the entanglements,
the progressive advance, the obstructions, the retrograde and opposing forces and
influences connected with the oscillations of the reform in England. Nowhere else in our
abounding literature on the subject are the Puritans and Nonconformists presented more
faithfully and intelligently in their conscientious, scrupulous, and certainly well-meant
efforts, within the Church itself, to have its institutions, ceremonial, and discipline disposed
after a pattern which should have regard equally to discountenance the impositions and
superstitions of the Papal system, which had been nominally renounced, and to make the
purified Church a power to advance the best interests of true religion. The intelligent
American visitor to Zurich, if his attention is drawn to this highly valued and admirably
arranged collection in its library, can hardly fail of the impression that he has before him
most sincere evidences of the depth of thought and the nobleness of spirit of men who
were working out the principles of wisdom and righteousness.</p>

<p>Considering the influence exerted upon some of the English Puritans by their residence
on the Continent, and their frequent reference afterward to the different ecclesiastical
system and discipline adopted there, an interesting phase of the controversy is
presented in the two following works. At the opening of the eighteenth century, Dr.
William Nichols,&mdash;as he says, at the prompting of others, though, it was intimated,
of his own motion,&mdash;wrote a <i>Defence of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of
England</i>, addressed especially to foreign divines and churches. This was replied to by
James Peirce in his <i>Vindication of the Dissenters; or, an Appeal to Foreign Divines,
Professors, and all other Learned Men of the Reformed Religion</i>. In this volume, originally
written and published in Latin, afterward translated by the author and published in
English, there is in the main a thorough and candid review of the rise and the conduct of
the cause of Nonconformity, and a searching examination of the principles of the Church
of England. Peirce quotes with care the original authorities, and puts them to a good
use. He follows the history into the fortunes of those who had taken refuge and established
their religion in New England, and while he says he differs with Mr. Cotton, of
Boston, “in many of his opinions,” defends him and all the “Independents” from the
charge of being “Brownists.”</p>

<p>The historians Bancroft and Motley and Dr. H. M. Dexter have, after diligent
research in Holland, discovered many little scraps of curious information relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
residence, mode of life, social and domestic experiences, and way of conducting their
religious affairs, of the earliest English exiles there associated in churches and assemblies.
These slight memorials indicate that the Puritans and Separatists in refuge there,
though their circumstances were modest, if not obscure, were respected for their characters
and for the sincerity of their purposes. They found conveniences from the presses in
Holland for putting into print their own fertile productions in the setting forth of their
principles, while the busy commerce between the ports of Holland and those of England
and Scotland furnished ready means for conveying these publications, as well as private
letters, secretly and surreptitiously if it were necessary, to the safe hands of friends. Nor,
if the occasion was urgent, would one of these refugees hesitate, taking in his hands the
risk of his liberty or life, to pass the seas on some secret errand in his own behalf or in
the interest of his fellows. Such scraps of information from Dutch repositories as the
explorers above named have gathered have all been duly valued as filling gaps in our
previous knowledge, or clearing up some obscure passages. The results have been so
gratefully recognized and at once incorporated in the many modern rehearsals of the
old history, that they need not be referred to more specifically here.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">English Authorities.</span>&mdash;All such periods of intense controversy and struggle upon
themes of the highest concern to man, as that of the internal commotions in England immediately
following and consequent upon the Reformation, leave behind them some memorial
in literature of so conspicuous and rare an excellence as to insure perpetual freshness, and
to acquire interest and attractions even beyond that of the particular subject with which it
deals. When the Press in such periods is pouring its outflow of ephemeral tracts and
books, vigorous, intense, effective, as they may be for a temporary end or for the circle of
a sect or party, genius or scholarly culture, or a philosophical and comprehensive spirit,
penetrating below the surface and rising above the details of a controversy, will engage
itself upon the product of what we call an immortal work. Such a work<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> is that which
came from the pen of “the judicious Hooker,”&mdash;Richard by baptismal name. His eight
books constitute one of the richest classics of the English tongue. It finds delighted
readers among those who care little, if at all, for the mere issues of the questions under
controversy. Its generally rich and stately style, its logic and rhetoric, its wealth of
learning, and its occasional play of satire or contempt, engage the interest of many a
reader who would turn listlessly from most pages of polemics. There is so much in it of
a manly, free courage and self-asserting spirit, that at times it is difficult to believe that it
was written by one who, according to the quaint biography of him by Isaack Walton, was
so cowed and subjugated by his domestic partner, the mother of his children. English
Churchmen may well boast themselves on this majestic work, dealing with the nucleus of
the whole Puritan controversy, the question of Church authority. Of course, its argument
in its whole sum and detail, in its array and estimate of original vouchers, has been traversed
and brought under dispute by champions on the other side. But it will always
hold its supreme place while the cause which it upholds shall need a classic.</p>

<p>Hallam<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> says that, “though the reasonings of Hooker won for him the surname of
‘the Judicious,’ they are not always safe or satisfactory, nor, perhaps, can they be reckoned
wholly clear or consistent. His learning, though beyond that of most English writers in
that age, is necessarily uncritical; and his fundamental theory, the mutability of ecclesiastical
government, has as little pleased those for whom he wrote, as those whom he
repelled by its means.” The same writer, in another work,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> passes a high encomium upon
Hooker’s <i>Polity</i>, as finding a basis for its argument in natural law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The first four of the books of Hooker’s work were published in 1594, the fifth in 1597.
As the other three had been left in manuscript, and did not appear in print till many years
after his death in 1600, suspicions were raised that they might have been interpolated.
As the Narrative of this chapter has given place to an exposition of Hooker’s fundamental
position against the Nonconformists, it need not be repeated here.</p>

<p>For a long period, the well-known work<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> of Daniel Neal, in its successive editions,
was the only one written from an historical point of view by an author not contemporary
with its whole subject, which had appeared from the press, was widely circulated and generally
accredited for its fidelity, its ability, and its trustworthiness. Mr. Neal, born in
London in 1678, was a Dissenting minister in that city, and died in 1743. His history
was published in portions between 1731 and 1738. The editions of it now in general circulation
are those edited with valuable notes by Dr. Toulmin, the first of which appeared
in London in 1793, and the last in 1837. The editor continued the history after the English
Revolution. Mr. Neal made diligent research, in order to verify his statements from all the
original sources which were open to him. He relied largely on the laborious <i>Memorials</i>
gathered by the painstaking Strype, while owing much to Fuller and Burnet. Mosheim
accepted Neal’s work as of the highest authority. Dr. Kippis commends it highly in the
<i>Biographia Britannica</i>. After the publication of his first volume, Neal made public his
answer to an anonymous work by Dr. Maddox, Bishop of St. Asaph, vindicating the
Church of England “from the injurious reflections cast upon it in that volume.” Similar
animadversions were cast upon the later volumes by Dr. Zachary Grey. Bishop Warburton,
in some <i>Notes</i> to Mr. Neal’s history which he published in 1788, even brings in question
the author’s veracity. Dr. Toulmin meets and answers such charges. Mr. Neal
sought to give his pages authenticity by full quotations, citations, and references to his
original authorities. In a few instances in which Burnet or others denied his fairness or
accuracy, Dr. Toulmin has vindicated him against all aspersions, if not from all charges
of error. The author wrote when the Dissenters were relieved by legislation of the
severe impositions, fines, and inflictions of an earlier period, but were by no means brought
into an equality in social and civil rights and privileges with the favored and patronized
members of the Church Establishment. So Mr. Neal’s pages are free from the asperity
and bitterness provoked into indulgence by his predecessors under the smart of humiliating
wrongs. Still, he is loyal to the memory and steadfastness of those earlier sufferers.
There was much on which the Dissenters of his time might pride themselves as won by
the constancy of those who had fought for them the battles with lordly arrogance and
hierarchical assumptions and prerogatives. There was a palmy age for Dissent in England
which Lord Macaulay describes very felicitously, when, as he says, there were Dissenting
ministers whose standing and condition in life compared favorably with those of
all the clergy of the Establishment below those of the bishops. Among the Dissenting
laity were men of wealth and of commercial consequence, as a high and honored social
class, whose munificent endowments were bestowed on some of the noblest institutions
of the realm.</p>

<p>Mr. Hallam devotes the second, third, and fourth chapters of his <i>Constitutional History
of England</i> to the development of the history of Nonconformity, both among Roman
Catholics and Protestants, during the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and
Elizabeth. Among the many reviews and critical estimates of this history, that in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, vol. xlviii., is especially able and satisfactory. Mr. Hallam brought
to the presentation of this part of his whole subject, not only his habitually thorough and
conscientious fulness of research among authorities and documents, public and private,
but also that spirit of candor, moderation, and equitable impartiality which, if not already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
cherished in the purposes and motives of one intending the task of an historian, may or
may not be acquired and exercised in dealing with themes engaging so much of temper,
strife, and intenseness of polemical animosity. From his point of view, reading backwards
along the line of historical development, he recognized that the early Nonconformists
were dealing with fundamental principles in religious affairs which, though not at the
time fully apprehended, would necessarily involve immunities and rights of a political character.
It is because of this, now clearly exposed and certified to us, that such lofty tributes
are rendered to the Puritans as the exponents and champions of English liberty.</p>

<p>The <i>Inner Life</i><a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> of Robert Barclay, not completely, though substantially, finished and
supervised by its author, is an admirable example of the more wise, just, and considerate
tone and method adopted in quite recent years for dealing with times and subjects of
once embittered religious agitation and controversy. It is calm and judicial in its temper,
inclusive and well-digested in its materials and contents. The author’s research was most
wide and comprehensive. He spared no labor in the quest of original documents, in
manuscript or print, all over England and on the Continent, of prime use and authority
for his purpose, whether in public repositories or in private cabinets. For some very
important matters which entered into the full treatment of his theme he has used for the
first time many records that had been lying in undisturbed repose, and he has enlisted the
valuable aid of many friends.</p>

<p>The author, after defining the idea and object of a visible church, makes an elaborate
effort to trace to its sources and in its course the development of religious opinion in
England previous to 1640. He marks the rise of Barrowism, Brownism, of the Johnsonists,
the Separatists, the Presbyterians, the early Independents, the two parties of Baptists,
and the Friends, or Quakers. Some of the views, habits, and principles adopted
by these parties he traces in their connection with the Mennonites on the Continent.
He distinguishes, as far as possible, the various shades of opinion, the introduction of
new points of controversy or discussion, the individualisms, extravagancies, eccentricities,
and erratic excesses of individuals or parties, and he keeps distinct the two main currents
of the development, as they favored or rejected the connection of civil and ecclesiastical
authority. He draws the line distinctly between the Episcopalians and Presbyterians, on
the one side, as according in favoring a state church and a national establishment, and
the original ideas gradually developed into positive principles of individuals and societies
among the Separatists, which involved the complete separation of the administration of
religion from the civil power.</p>

<p>The central subject of Mr. Barclay’s volume is the early history of the Friends, or
Quakers. Two chief points are specially dealt with: First, many of the distinctive principles
in their teaching and conduct which have been generally regarded as original with
them are traced as in full recognition by other parties previous to the preaching of George
Fox. Second, the author presents many facts, new, or in a new light, which disclose how
earnest were the efforts of the early Friends for a very careful and even elaborate inner
organization and discipline of their membership, after the manner of a visible Church,&mdash;the
appointment and oversight of a qualified ministry, the sending out of authorized missionaries,
and the inquisition into the private affairs, the home life, habits, and business
of members, carried out into very minute and annoying details. He reveals to us the
embarrassments met by them in deciding upon the question of “birthright membership.”
Manuscript documents, records, minute-books, etc., preserved in many places where the
early Friends had their meetings, are found very communicative.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Skeats, in his <i>Free Churches</i><a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> has in view as his general purpose, to trace “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
part which English Dissent has played in the history of England.” Following this comprehensive
design, he presents the various phases of Nonconformity and Separatism
through denominational organizations among Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, Independents,
and Congregationalists, noting the attitude of opposition assumed towards them by
the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. He regards the Toleration Act, passed in 1689,&mdash;which
even then excluded the Unitarians from its terms,&mdash;as drawing the line between
the efforts which had been made up to that time to extinguish Dissent, and the leaving it
simply under a stigma, as lacking social standing and Government recognition. Only the
first chapter, covering a hundred of the six hundred pages of the volume, is concerned
with the subject directly in our hands. The author is in full sympathy with the principles
and the cause, the attitude and the persistency, of the resolute and buffeted men whose
views he sets forth, as developed from the earliest stage of the Reformation in England.
He cites and quotes original authorities to authenticate his statements and his judgments.
In some instances, where they bear hard upon the conduct of the archbishops of Canterbury
under Queen Elizabeth, Curteis, in his <i>Bampton Lectures</i>, challenges their fairness. More
than four hundred Dissenting societies, Congregationalist and Baptist, are now existing
in England, which date their origin before the passage of the Toleration Act under
William.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> To these are to be added many societies of Presbyterians and Quakers.</p>

<p>The Congregational Union of England and Wales is an organized body devoted to the
interests of the fellowship to which it succeeds as representing the original single and
associated Nonconformists from the date of the English Reformation. Its magazines, its
annual reports, and various publications issued under its patronage, keep in living interest
and advocacy the principles first stood for by faithful witnesses, sufferers, and martyrs.
One of these publications, of especial importance, bears the following title: <i>Historical
Memorials relating to the Independents, or Congregationalists, from their Rise to the Restoration
of the Monarchy</i>, 1660, London, 1839. The distinctive value and authority of
this work, which is in four octavo volumes, attach to its being almost exclusively composed
of the original writings, of various kinds, from the pens of the first Nonconformists, and
the answers or arguments brought against them. These have been gathered by keen and
extended investigation, carefully authenticated, and, where it is necessary, annotated. The
motive which inspired this undertaking was to remove the obscurity and contumely which
had been threatening to settle over the memory and principles of men whose own writings
prove them to have been equal in learning, acumen, argumentative power, and heroic constancy
of purpose to defend a cause by them thought worthy of their devotion. Many
important papers which elsewhere are found only in quotations, extracts, or fragments,
are here given in full.</p>

<p>The Bi-Centennial commemoration of the ejectment of all Nonconforming ministers
from the parish churches of England, on St. Bartholomew’s Day, 1662, was made the
occasion, after modern usage for such observances, of the delivery of a multitude of addresses,
and the preparation and publication of numerous pamphlets and volumes, of local
or general interest, with historical retrospect and review of the origin and development of
English Nonconformity. Curteis<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> has a very pregnant note on the “bicentenary rhetoric”
connected with this occasion. He alleges that “incredible exaggerations” were exposed,
as founded upon the lists given in Calamy’s famous Nonconformist Memorial (edited by
Palmer) of the ejected ministers, as being in number two thousand. Curteis says it was
proved that instead of there being 293 such in London parishes, there were by count only
127, and that from the whole alleged number of two thousand, there should be struck off
no less than twelve hundred.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three very admirable works<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> covering much of the matter of this chapter,
from the pen of John Tulloch, D.D., Principal of St. Mary’s College in the University
of St. Andrew’s.</p>

<p>Though these three works are from the pen of a clergyman of the Church of Scotland,
they are written in a spirit of the most broad and comprehensive catholicity. They set
forth with keen discernment and with generous appreciation the advances made by highly
gifted individual minds in the several stages and phases of the development of a protracted
controversy upon the principles involved in an attempted adjustment of the rights
of conscience and free thought, in asserting themselves against traditional and ecclesiastical
proscriptions. It required the contributions from many such minds and spirits,
with their fragments of certified truth, to insure the substitution of reason for authority.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Church of England Authorities.</span>&mdash;Among the recently published works, the authors
of which have aimed with moderation and impartiality to treat a theme of embittered
relations and rehearsals so as to present readers with information of facts and the means
of judging fairly between violent contestants in their once angry issues, is one already referred
to as Curteis’s <i>Bampton Lectures</i>.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Assuming that the English Church had an origin
and existence independent of the ecclesiastical authority of the Pope, the author relates
the process by which it reformed itself, by renouncing his interference and impositions,
and establishing its own discipline and ritual. After this he regards and treats the
Romanists as but one class of Dissenters, taking their place as such with the Independents,
the Baptists, the Quakers, the Unitarians, and the Wesleyans. Of these divided
elements of the common Christian fold, the author traces the rise, the leading principles,
and the distinct institutions and methods which they adopted. His treatment of his large
and tangled subject is as fair, considerate, and judicious as could be expected from an
earnest and heartily loyal minister of the English Church. He makes many strong statements
to commend and urge a national establishment of religion as far more dignified,
consistent, and desirable than the scattering and fragmentary multiplication, indefinitely
increasing under petty variances, of independent religious organizations. But he does not
work out a practicable method for his suggested scheme when those concerned in it prefer
their own ways. Mr. Curteis is very severe (p. 62) in his rebuke upon the harshness of
terms in which Mr. Skeats<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> deals with Archbishop Parker, in the course pursued by him
towards the Puritans. But the view presented by Mr. Skeats is more than justified by
Hallam,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> in his calm dealing with the original documents.</p>

<p>In the same connection may be mentioned <i>The Church and Puritans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> a small and
compact volume, written in the best spirit of moderation and candor. In but little more
than two hundred open pages, the author traces the whole course of Dissent,&mdash;its rise,
aims, principles, and methods, and its struggles, buffetings, and discomfitures, from its
manifestations under Elizabeth to the failure of “a glorious opportunity of reconciling all
moderate Dissenters to the communion of the Church of England, under William and
Mary.” By the judicious restraint upon what might naturally be his promptings, as a
clergyman of the Church of England, to criticise with some sharpness what has so generally
been represented as the perversity and weak scrupulosity of the Puritans, he is
eminently fair and considerate in presenting their side of the controversy, and in dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with their more conspicuous men. The abounding citation of original authorities on both
sides in his notes authenticates, for nearly every sentence of the work, the statement made
in it.</p>

<p>Two works of a remarkably liberal and scholarly character which have quite recently
appeared from the pens of eminent divines of the English Church, would have been gratefully
welcomed by the Nonconformists in the period of their sharpest conflict, on account
of their generous spirit and their contents. They would have been especially noteworthy
in the liberal concessions which they make upon all the points involved in the controversy,
as to the simple authority and pattern of Scripture in the constitution and discipline of
the Christian Church, as against the hierarchical claims based upon traditions and usages
subsequent to the age of the apostles, and traceable in the so-called Primitive Church.
These books are Mr. Edwin Hatch’s <i>Organization of the Early Christian Churches</i>,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and
Dean Stanley’s <i>Christian Institutions</i>.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hatch has also published articles of a similar tenor to the contents of his Bampton
Lectures, in the <i>Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</i>. In these lectures, the author aims
to trace the facts of ecclesiastical history in the same way as those of civil history are usually
dealt with. His aim is to investigate the framework of the earliest Christian societies.
He says these societies in their formation adjusted themselves to previously existing
methods of association. The philanthropic element in them suggested the sort of officers
needed, their provinces and functions. A president of the society and one or more distributors
of alms were the requisite officers. Then as increasing numbers in a society, and
of societies, made necessary a distribution of functions, with centralization and subordination
of duty and authority, an ecclesiastical system was developed by like methods to
those of a civil or political system. Convenience and adaptation thus originated the

<p>Dean Stanley’s volume is a collection of essays, previously published separately. They
are liberal in tone and tenor, and by no means in harmony with, or even quite respectful
toward, any high-church principles, or any demands of “divine right” for ecclesiastical
authority. He adopts a rational point of view for marking the accumulation of sentiments
and usages around the original substance of Christianity. He exhibits the entire unlikeness
of conditions and needs between the early days of the religion and our own. He
recognizes the vast superstructure of fable reared upon original simple verities, and, like
Mr. Hatch, identifies the development of ecclesiastical with that of civil forms and usages.</p>

<p>An <i>Essay on the Christian Ministry</i>, by Bishop Lightfoot, treats after a like unconventional
method, the themes which in the days of early Nonconformity were dealt with
in so different a tone and method.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">New England Authorities.</span><a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>&mdash;The authorities concerning every detail in the institution
and disposing of church affairs in New England are abundant and well-nigh
exhaustive. They may be consulted as digested and set in order in the more recently
published works to be here named by title, or they may be traced fragmentarily in chronological
order in the writings of the Fathers themselves. The organization of the New
England churches came to be best described under the term “Congregational.” It was
in substance a modification of Barrowism. While there seems to have been but little
discordancy here among those who followed the pattern, they were soon challenged by
some of their brethren in England most nearly in sympathy with them, as to doubtful or
debated principles and methods in their institution and discipline of churches. There
were two chief points which came under discussion: first, the respective rights of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
brethren composing a church fellowship in administering discipline, and those of the
pastor, teacher, and elders. Should the whole church, or only its officers, be primarily and
ultimately invested with executive and administrative power? The second point covered
all the considerations which would come into prominence in deciding upon the relations
of churches to each other,&mdash;whether each should maintain an absolute independency, or
qualify it in any way by seeking sympathy, fellowship, and advice, and heeding remonstrances
or interference from “sister churches,” through their teachers and elders.</p>

<p>Contemporary references to these matters as they presented themselves to the attention
of those who here first entered into a “church estate,” are scattered over Governor
Winthrop’s journal. John Cotton, minister of the First Church of Boston, diligently and
earnestly, in successive writings and publications, set himself to answering all questioning
and challenging friends abroad. He evidently had to work out clear and consistent views
of his own on a subject which, besides being novel in many of its relations, was embarrassed
by local difficulties, and by some conscientious or practical diversities of judgment
among his associates. Richard Mather, of Dorchester, also contributed his help in the exposition
of the Congregational polity, which was to be defended alike from extreme Barrowism
and from Presbyterianism, which was soon found to have some sympathizers in
the colony. By a sort of general consent, recourse was had to a succession of “synods,”
or councils of the representatives of the churches, first those of the Bay Colony alone,
then with some of the other New England colonies. These synods resulted in the formation
of a “Platform,” which laid out in form and detail the system of the Congregational
polity.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to indicate the titles, contents, and authors of the several publications,
preserved in our cabinets of relics, which contributed either to the dissension or
to the pacification of the sometimes eccentric and heated, and of the always scrupulous,
earnest, and independent parties in this work of ecclesiastical reconstruction. They have
been so faithfully, admirably, and impartially digested by Dr. Dexter in the eighth of the
lectures in his <i>Congregationalism</i>, as to present to the reader a full and intelligent view
of the whole subject in its development and its results, while relieving him of what save
to the fewest possible of historical students would be a repelling task. If, however, zeal
or curiosity should dispose any one to peer through those dried and withered relics of
the old polemics of a generation that drew its honey from the rocks, he will find much
occasion to respect the acuteness and the persistency of men who, having taken the interests
of their creed and piety into their own hands, determined to build on what was to
them the only sure foundation. That foundation was “the Word.” If the Scriptures, as
their prelatical foes insisted, were not intended to afford, and would not afford, a complete
pattern of a method of institution and government of a Christian Church, the reader of
those patiently wrought tractates will often be amazed as he notes how rich and fertile,
how apt and facile, the contents of the sacred books were found to be, in furnishing the
requisite material for argument and authority.</p>

<p>A controversial discussion was opened in 1861 by Hon. D. A. White, of Salem, by the
publication of his <i>New England Congregationalism in its Origin and Purity, illustrated
by the Foundation and Early Records of the First Church in Salem, and Various Discussions
pertaining to the Subject</i>. To this work Rev. J. B. Felt, in the same year, made an
answer: <i>Reply to the New England Congregationalism of Hon. D. A. White</i>. The
principal interest of the matter of these two publications consists in their arguments upon
the question whether Congregationalism as a system of polity in the constitution and government
of churches carries with it, as an essential organic part, the doctrinal creed held
by those who first adopted it. Dr. Dexter offers some suggestions on this point, arguing
that the creed of the first Congregationalists belongs continuously to their system of
polity. Of course, only constructive and inferential arguments can be brought to bear on
this point. As we have seen, from the first manifestations of Nonconformity and Dissent
in England, doctrinal themes did not at all enter into the controversy, it being taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
for granted that there was accord upon them. But there certainly is no absolute, vital
connection between a form of polity and a doctrinal system. There have come to be very
many organizations and fellowships among Protestants which are substantially Congregational
in their order, while widely diverse in their creeds.</p>

<p>In 1862, Mr. Felt published <i>The Ecclesiastical History of New England</i>.</p>

<p>Very full and curiously interesting information about the principles, persons, and
events connecting the Puritan controversy in the Old World with the settlement of New
England, may be found in the now well-nigh innumerable volumes containing the history
of our oldest towns and churches. In their earlier pages or chapters these histories find
the town and the church a common theme. Grateful occasions have been found in commemorations
of bi-centennial or longer periods, from the settlement of municipalities or
the foundation of parishes, to review the past, and to trace in the old land the men who
brought here in their exile, for free and successful enjoyment, principles for which they
had there suffered. The history of the Reformation and of Nonconformity might indeed
be largely written from the pamphlets and the volumes called out by these local commemorations,
so numerous during the last decade of years. Traces of matter of a similar
character may also be found in the personal and historical references, in text or note, of
the first volume of the <i>Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Harvard University</i>,
by John Langdon Sibley. In connection with the public and formal observance of the
Two Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of the Founding of the First Church of Boston,&mdash;in
the fifth in order of the edifices in which it had worshipped,&mdash;a son of the present
pastor (the seventeenth in the line of succession) prepared and published a work
with the following title: <i>History of the First Church in Boston. 1630-1880. By Arthur
B. Ellis. With an Introduction by George E. Ellis. Illustrated.</i> Boston, 1881.

<p>Elizabeth’s policy of Uniformity, so sternly pursued by her last Archbishop
of Canterbury, Whitgift (1583-1604), was ostentatiously adopted
by her successor, James I., at the Hampton Court Conference held in his
presence by learned men of the Puritan and High Church parties in the
first year of his reign; and when this conference was quickly followed by
the elevation of Bancroft, a more arbitrary Whitgift, to Whitgift’s vacant
place, those who were earnest in the opposite opinions were forced to
choose between persecution and exile.</p>

<p>There were doubtless other neighborhoods where the Separatists maintained
thriving congregations for a longer or shorter time after the King’s
policy became known; but by far the most zealous company of which
accounts remain was one formed by residents “of sundry towns and villages,
some in Nottinghamshire, some of Lincolnshire, and some of Yorkshire,
where they border nearest together.” In 1602, or thereabout, these people,
from places at least eight or ten miles apart, gathered themselves into a
church,&mdash;probably at Gainsborough, a market-town in Lincolnshire, on the
Trent; at least we know that when the original congregation divided, in
1605 or 1606, into two,&mdash;perhaps for greater security,
as well as for local convenience,&mdash;it was
at Gainsborough that one branch remained, which
soon chose John Smyth, a Cambridge graduate,
who had been some time with them, to be its pastor, and that with him
many of this portion of the parent stock migrated in 1606 to Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The western division of the original company appears to have been
formed into a distinct church in the summer of 1606, and, according to the
testimony of Governor Bradford, in his notice of Elder Brewster, “they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
ordinarily met at his [Brewster’s] house on the Lord’s day (which was a
manor [<i>i. e.</i> manor-house] of the Bishop’s), and with great love he entertained
them when they came, making provision for them, to his great
charge.”</p>

upper of these two, as from a book in the British

by the same hand as the lower of the two, which,
with another very like it, is upon the title of Sir

book show its author to have been “much in advance
of his time,” and that there is “a correspondency
in some parts with the celebrated
Farewell Address of Robinson.” It is easy to
suppose, therefore, that Robinson once owned
the little treatise. Hunter errs in assigning 1687
as the date of its first edition. That of 1605 is
called in the 1629 edition a surreptitious one, and
there is a copy in the Boston Athenæum, with
MS. annotations said to be by the author. Dr.
Dexter points out 1629 as the year of the first

<p>William Brewster, the chief layman of this congregation, was postmaster,
or “post,” as the usual term was, at Scrooby, a small village in the northern
part of Nottinghamshire, ten miles west of Gainsborough. Though Scrooby
was a mere hamlet, its station on the London and Edinburgh post-road gave
Brewster full occupation, especially after the two capitals were united under
one king, as it was his duty to provide food and lodging for all travellers by
post on Government business, as well as relays of horses for them and for
the conveyance of Government despatches. He was a native of the village,
and had matriculated in 1580 at the University of Cambridge, where he
came under Puritan influence; he soon, however, quitted his books to enter
the service of William Davison, Elizabeth’s upright and Puritan Secretary
of State, whose promising career was sacrificed to her duplicity in the
matter of the execution of Mary Stuart. Under Davison, Brewster had
experience both at court and in foreign embassies; he remained with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
master for a year or two after the fall of the latter in 1587, and then retired
to his native village. There he assisted his father, who was then postmaster,
until the latter’s death in 1590; and after a brief interval the son, then
about twenty-three years of age,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
succeeded to the father’s place
through the intercession of his
old patron, Davison.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>In 1603 his
annual stipend from the Government
was raised from £30 to £36,
the two sums corresponding in
present values to perhaps six
and seven hundred dollars respectively.
The manor-house of
Scrooby, built originally as a hunting-seat
for the Archbishops of
York, though in Brewster’s time
“much decayed,”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> had been occupied
for many years by his
father as bailiff for the archbishops,
and as representative of their
vested interests in the surrounding
property, which was leased to
Sir Samuel Sandys, of London.</p>

<p>The clerical leaders of the church, meeting in the great hall or chapel
under Brewster’s roof, were Richard Clyfton and John Robinson. The
former had been instituted in 1586, at the age of
thirty-three, rector of Babworth, a village six or
seven miles southeast of Scrooby, and had continued
there until the undisguised Puritanism of
his teachings caused his removal, probably in connection
with Archbishop Bancroft’s summary proceedings
against Nonconformist ministers at the
end of 1604. His associate, Robinson, apparently
a native of the neighborhood, had entered Cambridge University in 1592,
and after gaining a Fellowship had spent some years in the ministry in or
near Norwich; but about 1604 he threw up his cure on conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
grounds, and returning to the North, allied himself with Separatists in
Gainsborough. He was, by the testimony of an opponent (Robert Baillie),
“the most learned, polished, and modest spirit among the Brownists.”</p>

<p>After they had covenanted together in church relations, “they could not
long continue in any peaceable condition, but were hunted and persecuted
on every side.... For some were taken and clapped up in prison; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
had their houses beset and watched night and day, and hardly escaped their
hands; and the most were fain to fly and leave their houses and habitations.
... Seeing themselves thus molested, and that there was no hope of their
continuance there, by a joint consent they resolved to go into the Low
Countries, where they heard was freedom of religion for all men.”</p>

<p>The remedy of exile was not new to a generation that could remember
the emigration of Robert Browne’s followers from Norwich to Zealand in
1581, and had witnessed the transfer of their
Gainsborough neighbors to Holland shortly after
their own organization. “So, after they had continued together about a
year, and kept their meetings every Sabbath in one place or other, ...
seeing they could no longer continue in that condition, they resolved
to get over into Holland as they could.” A large number attempted, in
the latter part of the year 1607, to embark at Boston in Lincolnshire, the
most convenient seaport for them, though fifty miles distant from Scrooby.
But emigration, except with a license, was in general prohibited by an early
statute (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1389), and the ship’s captain, who had engaged to take them,
found it to his interest to betray them in the act of embarking; so that
the only result for most of them was a month’s detention in Boston jail,
and the confiscation of their goods, while seven of the leaders, including
Brewster, were kept in prison still longer. In a new attempt the following
spring, an unfrequented strip of sea-coast in northeastern Lincolnshire,
above Great Grimsby, was selected, and a bargain made with a Dutch captain
to convey the party thence to Holland; then, perhaps, taking advantage
of the Idle, a sluggish stream flowing near their doors, tributary to the Trent,
and so to the Humber, the women and children, with all the household
goods, were in that case despatched by water, while the men marched some
forty miles across country to the rendezvous. But after a part of the men
(who arrived first) had embarked, on the appearance of armed representatives
of the law the captain took alarm and departed; some of those left on
shore fled, and reached their destination by other means; but the women
and children, with a few of the men and all their valuables, were captured.
Another season of suspense followed; but at length the absurdity of
detaining such a helpless group began to be felt, the magistrates were glad
to be rid of them, and by August, 1608, the last of the straggling unfortunates
got safely over to Amsterdam.</p>

<p>They found there the church of English Separatists transplanted under
Francis Johnson upwards of twenty years before, as well as that of John
Smyth and his Gainsborough people; but the
church from Scrooby appears to have kept its
separate organization, and their experience is
calmly recounted by their historian, Bradford, as follows: “When they
had lived at Amsterdam about a year, Mr. Robinson, their pastor, and
some others of best discerning, seeing how Mr. John Smyth and his
company was already fallen into contention with the church that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
there before them, and no means they could use would do any good to
cure the same; and also that the flames of contention were like to break
out in the ancient church itself (as afterwards lamentably came to pass),&mdash;which
things they prudently foreseeing, thought it was best to remove,
before they were anyway engaged with the same; though they well knew
it would be much to the prejudice of their outward estates, both at present
and in likelihood in the future,&mdash;as, indeed, it proved to be.”</p>

<p>For these, with other reasons, in the winter after their arrival they asked
the authorities of Leyden, an inland city, twenty miles or more southwest
from Amsterdam, and the next in size to it in the province, to allow their
congregation, of about one hundred English men and women, to remove
thither by May 1, 1609.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The application was granted, and the removal to
that beautiful city was accomplished, probably in May; but their senior
pastor, Clyfton, being oppressed with premature infirmity, preferred to
remain in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>In Leyden they were forced to adapt themselves, as they had begun to
do hitherto, to conditions of life very unlike those to which they had been
trained in their own country; and so far as we can trace them, a majority
of the flock seem to have found employment in the manufacture of the
woollen goods for which the city was
famous. Upon the public records
the church appears as an organized
body early in 1611, when Robinson
with three others purchased for 8,000
guilders (corresponding in our currency
to perhaps $10,000 or $12,000)
a valuable estate in the centre of the
city, including a spacious house for
the pastor, used also for Sunday worship,
and at the back of the garden
an area large enough for the subsequent erection of twenty-one small
residences for church members.</p>

<p>Among additional reasons which had led the studious Robinson to favor
the removal to Leyden, may be counted the fact that it was the site of a
university already famous, and so furnished ample opportunities of intercourse
with learned men and of access to valuable libraries. The sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
controversy between the occupants of the chair of theology, Gomarus
and Arminius, involving no personal risk to the English spectators, was
an added attraction; and before long Robinson himself appeared as a
disputant on the Calvinist side in the public discussions, and so successfully
that by Bradford’s testimony “the Arminians stood more in fear of him
than [of] any of the University.” This perhaps opened the way for his
admission to membership of the University, which took place in September,
1615, and secured
him valuable
civil as well
as literary privileges.
Such an
honor was justified
also by the
activity of his
pen while in
exile. Between
1610 and 1615
he published
four controversial
pieces, of
nearly seven
hundred quarto
pages, the most
important being a popularly written Justification of Separation from the
Church of England. In the same field of argument were the other treatises;
while in 1619, when public attention was absorbed with the Synod of Dort,
he brought out in Latin a brief but telling <i>Apologia</i>, or Defence of the views
of the Separatists, in distinction from those of the Dutch churches.</p>

<p>These outside discussions, in which their pastor took such interest, left
undisturbed the steady growth of the Pilgrim church, in the government of
which Brewster, as ruling elder, was associated with Robinson, after the
removal to Leyden. In these years “many came unto them from divers
parts of England, so as they grew a great congregation,” numbering at
times nearly three hundred communicants. Among these new-comers were
some who ranked thenceforth among their principal men: John Carver,
an early deacon of the church, and leader of the first migrating colony;
Robert Cushman, Carver’s adjutant in effecting that migration; Miles
Standish, the soldier of the company; and Edward Winslow, a young man
probably of higher social position than the rest, who shared with Bradford,
after Carver’s death, the main burden of sustaining the infant colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>But though some recruits were attracted by Robinson’s gifts and by a
prospect of freedom from prelatical oppression, yet the condition of the
Leyden people was in general one of struggling poverty, with little hope of
amendment. It were vain to expect that their language or their peculiarities
of religious order could gain a secure foothold on Dutch soil, or that a
Government on friendly terms with England could show active good-will to
a nest of outcasts which England was anxious to break up. The increase
of numbers had come in spite of the hardships attending the struggle for a
livelihood in a foreign city; but as the conditions of the struggle were
better understood, the numbers fell off. Time was also bringing a new
danger with the approaching expiration of the twelve years’ truce (April,
1609-April, 1621) between Spain and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>As years passed, the older generation among the exiles who clung loyally
to the English name and tongue began to realize that a great part of
their aims would be frustrated if their children should, by intermarriage
with the Dutch and other outside influences, wander from their fathers’
principles, and be absorbed in the Dutch people. These dangers being
recognized, and the major part of the company being agreed that it was
best to avoid them by a removal, it became necessary to select a new asylum,
where Englishmen might preserve their nationality undisturbed. To
the new continent of America, which best satisfied the conditions, all
thoughts turned as early as the summer of 1617; and the respective claims
were weighed of tropical Guiana on the one hand, which Raleigh had described
in 1595 as the true Eldorado, and Virginia on the other, conspicuous
as the seat of the first successful English colony. A little consideration
excluded Guiana, with its supposed wealth of gold tempting the jealousy
of the Spaniard; and so the choice was limited to the territory somewhat
vaguely known as Virginia, within the bounds assigned to the two companies
chartered by King James in 1606. The objection was duly weighed
“that if they lived among the English which were there planted [<i>i.e.</i> on the
James River], or so near them as to be under their government, they should
be in as great danger to be troubled or persecuted for the cause of religion
as if they lived in England; and it might be worse. And if they lived too
far off, they should neither have succor nor defence from them.”</p>

<p>There were risks either way; but they decided, under the advice of some
persons of rank and quality at home,&mdash;friends, perhaps, of Brewster’s
when at court, or of Winslow’s,&mdash;to dare the dangers from wild beasts and
savages in the unsettled parts of Virginia, rather than the dangers from
their own bigoted countrymen, and to ask the King boldly for leave to
continue as they were in church matters.</p>

<p>Their first care was for the regular sanction of the Virginia Company in
London to the settlement of the proposed colony on their territory; and
with this object Carver and Cushman were despatched to England as
agents, apparently in September, 1617. They took with them, for use in
conciliating the sentiments which any petition from a community with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
history would awaken at court, a memorable declaration in seven articles,
signed by the pastor and elder, which professed their full assent to the doctrines
of the Church of England, as well as their acknowledgment of the
King’s supremacy and of the obedience due to him, “either active, if the
thing commanded be not against God’s Word, or passive [<i>i.e.</i> undergoing
the appointed penalties], if it be.” The same articles, in carefully guarded
language, recognized as lawful the existing relations of Church and State in
England, and disavowed the notion of authority inhering in any assembly
of ecclesiastical officers, except as conferred by the civil magistrate. In
any estimate of the Pilgrims, it is necessary to give full weight to this deliberate
record of their readiness to tolerate other opinions.</p>

<p>The two messengers found the Virginia Company in general well disposed,
and gained an active friend in Sir Edwin Sandys (a prominent
member of the Company and brother of Sir Samuel Sandys, the lessee of
Scrooby Manor), who, though no Puritan, was a firm advocate of toleration;
but as he was also a leader of the Parliamentary Opposition, his friendship
was a doubtful recommendation to royal favor. Their report, on their
return in November, was so encouraging that Carver and another were sent
over the next month for further negotiations with the Virginia Company
and with the King. But the former business still halted, because of the
prejudice in official minds against their independent practices in church
government. Sir Edwin Sandys, Sir Robert Naunton (one of the Secretaries
of State), and other friends labored early in 1618 with the King for
a guarantee of liberty of religion; but the ecclesiastical authorities were
strong in their opposition, there was a suspicion abroad that the design was
“to make a free popular State there,”<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> and the delegates returned to Leyden
to propose that a patent be taken on the indirect assurance of the King
“that he would connive at them and not molest them, provided they carried
themselves peaceably.” It seemed wisest to proceed, and Brewster
(now fifty-two years of age, one of the oldest and most experienced of the
congregation) and Cushman were commissioned in the spring of 1619 to
procure a patent from the Virginia Company, and to complete an arrangement
with some London merchants who had partially agreed to advance
funds for the undertaking. The business was delayed by a crisis in the
Virginia Company’s affairs, connected with the excited canvass attending
the election (April 28 [May 8], 1619) of Sir Edwin Sandys as Governor;
but at length the patent was granted (June 9/19, 1619), being taken by
the advice of friends, not in their own names, but in that of Mr. John Wincob
(or Whincop), described by Bradford as “a religious gentleman then
belonging to the Countess of Lincoln, who intended to go with them.”<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>When the patent was secured, Brewster appears to have returned to
Leyden at once, leaving Cushman for a time to negotiate with the merchants;
but so little was done or perhaps hoped for in this direction, that
an entirely new project was started the next winter under Robinson’s auspices.
Certain Amsterdam merchants, already interested in the rich fur-trade
on and near the Hudson River, presented a memorial to the States-General,
Feb. 2/12, 1620, from which it appears that Robinson had signified
his readiness to lead a colony of over four hundred English families to
settle under the Dutch in New Netherland, if assured of protection. The
memorial asked for assurances on this last head, and for the immediate
despatch of two ships of war to take formal possession of the lands to be
reserved for such a colony.</p>

<p>While this memorial was awaiting its (unfavorable) answer, Thomas
Weston, one of those London merchants with whom there had already been
consultations, came to Leyden as their agent, to propose a new arrangement
for a settlement in North Virginia. For some reason, not now clear, the
Pilgrims showed peculiar deference to his advice; and accordingly the negotiations
with the Dutch were broken off and articles of agreement with
the London merchants drawn up, embodying the conditions propounded by
Weston. By these conditions a common stock was formed, with shares of
ten pounds each, which might be taken up either by a deposit of money or
of goods necessary for the undertaking; and Carver and Cushman were
sent to England to collect subscriptions and to make purchases and preparations
for the voyage. In this service, while Carver was busy with the
ship in Southampton, Cushman took the responsibility of conceding certain
alterations in the agreement, to please the “merchant adventurers,” as they
were styled, whose part in the scheme was indispensable. The original
plan was for a seven years’ partnership, during which all the colonists’ labor&mdash;except
for two days a week&mdash;was to be for the common benefit; and
at the end of the time, when the resulting profits were divided, the houses
and improved lands in the colony were to go to the planters: but the
changes sanctioned by Cushman did away with the reservation of two days
in the week for each man’s private use, and arranged for an equal division,
after seven years, of houses, lands, and goods between the “merchant
adventurers” and the planters. Dr. Palfrey has well observed that “the
hardship of the terms to which the Pilgrims were reduced shows at once
the slenderness of their means and the constancy of their purpose.” About
seventy merchants joined in the enterprise, of whom only three&mdash;William
Collier, Timothy Hatherly, and William Thomas&mdash;became sufficiently interested
to settle in the colony.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding discouragements, the removal was pressed forward, but
the means at command provided only for sending a portion of the company;
and “those that stayed, being the greater number, required the
pastor to stay with them,” while Elder Brewster accompanied, in the
pastor’s stead, the almost as numerous minority who were to constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a church by themselves; and in every church, by Robinson’s theories, the
“governing elder,” next in rank to the pastor and the teacher, must be
“apt to teach.”</p>

<p>A small ship,&mdash;the “Speedwell,”&mdash;of some sixty tons burden, was
bought and fitted out in Holland, and early in July those who were ready
for the formidable voyage, being “the youngest and strongest part,” left
Leyden for embarkation at Delft-Haven, nearly twenty miles to the southward,&mdash;sad
at the parting, “but,” says Bradford, “they knew that they
were pilgrims.” About the middle of the second week of the month the
vessel sailed for Southampton, England. On the arrival there, they found
the “Mayflower,” a ship of about one hundred and eighty tons burden,
which had been hired in London, awaiting them with their fellow-passengers,&mdash;partly
laborers employed by the merchants, partly Englishmen
like-minded with themselves, who were disposed to join the colony. Mr.
Weston, also, was there, to represent the merchants; but when discussion
arose about the terms of the contract, he went off in anger, leaving
the contract unsigned and the arrangements so incomplete that the Pilgrims
were forced to dispose of sixty pounds’ worth of their not abundant
stock of provisions to meet absolutely necessary charges.</p>

<p>The ships, with perhaps one hundred and twenty passengers, put to sea
about August 5/15, with hopes of the colony being well settled before
winter; but the “Speedwell” was soon pronounced too leaky to proceed
without being overhauled, and so both ships put in at Dartmouth, after
eight days’ sail. Repairs were made, and before the end of another week
they started again; but when above a hundred leagues beyond Land’s End,
Reynolds, the master of the “Speedwell,” declared her in imminent danger
of sinking, so that both ships again put about. On reaching Plymouth
Harbor it was decided to abandon the smaller vessel, and thus to send back
those of the company whom such a succession of mishaps had disheartened.
Those who withdrew were chiefly such as from their own weakness
or from the weakness of their families were likely to be least useful in the
hard labor of colonization; the most conspicuous desertion was that of
Cushman, smarting under criticism and despairing of success. The unexpected
parting between those who disembarked and those who crowded
into the “Mayflower” was sad enough. It was not known till later that the
alarm over the “Speedwell’s” condition was owing to deception practised
by the master and crew, who repented of their bargain to remain a year
with the colony, and took this means of dissolving it.</p>

<p>At length, on Wednesday, September 6/16, the “Mayflower” left Plymouth,
and nine weeks from the following day, on November 9/19, sighted
the eastern coast of the flat, but at that time well-wooded, shores of Cape
Cod. She took from Plymouth one hundred and two passengers, besides
the master and crew; on the voyage one man-servant died and one child
was born making 102 (73 males and 29 females) who reached their destination.
Of these, the colony proper consisted of 34 adult males, 18 of
them accompanied by their wives and 14 by minor children (20 boys and 8
girls); besides these, there were 3 maid-servants and 19 men-servants,
sailors, and craftsmen,&mdash;5 of them only half-grown boys,&mdash;who were hired
for temporary service.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-four men who were the nucleus of
the colony, more than half are known to have come from Leyden; in fact,
but four of the thirty-four are certainly known to be of the Southampton
accessions. The ruling motive of the majority was, therefore, that which
had impelled the church in Leyden to this step, modified, perhaps, to some
small extent by their knowledge of the chief reason, as Bradford alleges, in
the minds of Weston and the others who had advanced them money, “for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the hope of present profit to be made by the fishing that was found in that
country” whither they were bound.</p>

<p>And whither were they bound? As we have seen, a patent was secured
in 1619 in Mr. Wincob’s name; but “God so disposed as he never went
nor they ever made use of this patent,” says Bradford,&mdash;not however making
it clear when the intention of colonizing under this instrument was abandoned.
The “merchant adventurers” while negotiating at Leyden seem to
have taken out another patent from the Virginia Company, in February,
1620, in the names of John Peirce and of his associates; and this was more
probably the authority under which the “Mayflower” voyage was undertaken.
As the Pilgrims had known before leaving Holland of an intended
grant of the northern parts of Virginia to a new company,&mdash;the Council for
New England,&mdash;when they found themselves off Cape Cod, “the patent
they had being for Virginia and not for New England, which belonged to
another Government, with which the Virginia Company had nothing to do,”
they changed the ship’s course, with intent, says Bradford, “to find some
place about Hudson’s River for their habitation,” and so fulfil the conditions
of their patent; but difficulties of navigation and opposition from the
master and crew caused the exiles, after half a day’s voyage, to retrace their
course and seek a resting-place on the nearest shore. Near half a century
after, a charge of treachery was brought against Mr. Jones, the master of
the “Mayflower,” for bringing the vessel so far out of her course; but the
alleged cause, collusion with the Dutch, who desired to keep the English
away from the neighborhood of New Netherland, is incredible.</p>

<p>But their radical change of destination exposed the colonists to a new
danger. As soon as it was known, some of the hired laborers threatened
to break loose (upon landing) from their engagements, and to enjoy full
license, as a result of the loss of the authority delegated in the Virginia
Company’s patent.</p>

<p>The necessity of some mode of civil government had been enjoined on
the Pilgrims in the farewell letter from their pastor, and was now availed
of to restrain these insurgents and to unite visibly the well-affected. A
compact, which has often been eulogized as the first written constitution
in the world, was drawn up, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the name of God, amen. We whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects
of our dread sovereign lord King James, by the grace of God of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, etc., having undertaken, for the
glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith, and honor of our King and
country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, do by
these presents solemnly and mutually, in the presence of God and one of another,
covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better
ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof
to enact, constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions,
and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient
for the general good of the Colony, unto which we promise all due submission and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
obedience. In witness whereof we have hereunder subscribed our names at Cape
Cod the 11th of November, in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord King James,
of England, France, and Ireland, the eighteenth, and of Scotland the fifty-fourth.
Anno Dom. 1620.”</p>

         <p class="pf400">[This is a reduction of part of a map, which
is given by Dr. H. M. Dexter in his edition of
<i>Mourt’s Relation</i>. He has carefully studied the
topography of the region in connection with the
record, and he possessed certain advantages in
such study over Dr. Young, who has similarly
investigated the matter in his <i>Chronicles of the
Pilgrims</i>. There were three expeditions from
the ship, and Dr. Dexter’s interpretation is followed.
The women were set ashore to wash at
<i>a</i>, and while the carpenter was repairing their
shallop, Standish and sixteen men started on the
15th November (O. S.) on the first expedition.
At <i>b</i> they saw some Indians and a dog, who disappeared
in the woods at <i>c</i>, and later ran up the
hill at <i>d</i>. The explorers encamped for the night
at <i>e</i>, and the next day, where they turned the
head of the creek, they drank their first New
England water. Then at <i>g</i> they built a fire as a
signal to those on the ship. At <i>h</i> they spent their
second night; at <i>j</i> they found plain ground fit
to plough; at <i>k</i> they opened a grave; at <i>l</i> dug
up some corn; at Pamet River they found an
old palisade and saw two canoes. They then
retraced their steps, and at <i>i</i> Bradford was caught
in a deer-trap. They reached the ship on the
17th. When the shallop was ready, ten days
later, a party of thirty-four started in her with
Jones, the captain of the “Mayflower,” as leader,
and the expedition, called the second on the
map, lasted from the 27th to the 30th November.
The third expedition, likewise in the shallop,
started on the 6th of December. Farther south
than the map carries the dotted line, they landed
at the modern Eastham, and had their first encounter
with the natives on the 8th, and the
same day reached Plymouth Harbor in the evening,
as narrated in the text. On the 12th the
shallop, sailing directly east across the bay, returned
to the “Mayflower,” which on Saturday,
the 16th, reached the anchorage depicted on the
map on the following page.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the forty-one signers to this compact, thirty-four were the adults
called above the nucleus of the colony, and seven were servants or hired
workmen; the seven remaining adult males of the latter sort were perhaps
too ill to sign with the rest (all of them soon died), or the list of signers
may be imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>This needful preliminary step was taken on Saturday, November 11/21,
by which time the “Mayflower” had rounded the Cape and found shelter
in the quiet harbor on which now lies the village of Provincetown; and
probably on the same day they “chose, or rather confirmed,” as Bradford
has it (as though the choice were the foregone conclusion of long previous
deliberation), Mr. John Carver governor for the ensuing year. On the
same day an armed delegation visited the neighboring shore, finding no
inhabitants. There were no attractions, however, for a permanent settlement,
nor even accommodations for a comfortable encampment while such
a place was being sought. After briefer explorations, an expedition started
on Wednesday, December 6/16, to circumnavigate Cape Cod Bay in search
of a good harbor, and by Friday night was safely landed on Clark’s Island
(so called from the ship’s mate, who was of the party), just within what is
since known as Plymouth Bay. On Saturday they explored the island, on
the Sabbath day they rested, and on Monday, the 11th,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> they sounded the
harbor and “marched also into the land, and found divers cornfields and
little running brooks, a place very good for situation.”<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

         <p class="pf400">[This is reduced from a map given in Dr.
Dexter’s edition of <i>Mourt’s Relation</i>. The Common
House of the first comers was situated on
Leyden Street, which left the shore just south
of the rock and ran to the top of Burial Hill,
and it is the lots on the south side of this street
that Bradford marked out in the fac-simile of
the first page of the record given on another
page. The “highway” as marked on that plan
led to the south to the Town Brook. The Common
House, if it had been designated on that
draft, would have been put next “Peter Brown;”
on the plan here given it would be on the north
side of the brook, about where the meridian
crosses it, though the engraver has put the designation
on the opposite side of the water. It was
not till about 1630, or ten years after their landing,
that the Plymouth settlers began to spread
around the bay, beyond the circuit of mutual protection.
Still for a year or two they scattered
merely for summer sojourns, to work lands which
had been granted them. About 1632 Duxbury began
to receive as permanent residents several of
the “Mayflower” people. Standish settled on the
shore southeast of Captain’s Hill, thus attaching
his military title to the neighboring eminence,
and though his grave is not known, it is
probable that he was buried, in 1656, on his
farm. His house stood, it is supposed, nearly
ten years longer, and was probably enlarged by
his son, Alexander Standish, who was, there is
some reason to believe, a trader, and he may
have been the town clerk of Duxbury. Its
records begin in 1666, and the tradition that
connects the destruction of the earlier records
with that of this house derives some color from
the traces of fire which have been discovered
about its site. (<i>Sabbath at Home</i>, May, 1867.)
The house now known as the Standish house
was built afterwards by Alexander, the son.
Elder Brewster became Standish’s neighbor a
little later, and lived east of the hill.</p>

<p class="pf400">Alden settled near the arm of the sea just west of

the map, Edward Winslow established his estate
of Careswell, where in our day Daniel Webster
lived and died, in Marshfield. John Howland
found a home at Rocky Nook. Isaac Allerton
removed to New Haven, and Governor
Bradford during his last years was almost

and by the middle of January most of the company had left the ship for a
home on land. But the exposures incident to founding a colony in the
dead of a New England winter (though later experience showed that this
was a comparatively mild one) told severely on all; and before summer
came one half of the number, most of them adult males, had fallen by the
way.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Yet when the “Mayflower” sailed homewards in April, not one of
the colonists went in her, so sweet was the taste of freedom, even under
the shadow of death.</p>

<p>An avowed motive of the emigration was the hope of converting the
natives; but more than three months elapsed before any intercourse with
the Indians began. Traces of their propinquity had been numerous, and
at length, on March 16/26, a savage visited the settlement, announcing
himself in broken English as Samoset, a native of “the eastern parts,” or
the coast of Maine, where contact with English fishermen had led to some
knowledge of their language. From Samoset the colonists learned that the
Indian name of their settlement was Patuxet, and that about four years before
a kind of plague had destroyed most of the inhabitants of that region,
so that there were now none to hinder their taking possession or to assert
a claim to the territory. They learned also that their nearest neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
were the Wampanoags, the headquarters of whose chief sachem, Massasoit,
were some thirty miles to the southwestward, near the eastern shore of
Narragansett Bay. The next week Samoset brought in Squanto, formerly
of Patuxet, who had been taken to England in 1614 by Hunt, and who was
now willing to act as interpreter in a visit from Massasoit; the latter followed
an hour later and contracted unhesitatingly a treaty of peace and
alliance, which was observed for fifty-four years.</p>

<p>With the beginning of a new civil year (March 25) Carver was re-elected
governor, and some simple necessary laws were established; on Carver’s
sudden death the following month, Bradford was chosen his successor, under
whose mild and wise direction the colony went on as before. As Bradford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
was then enfeebled by illness, Isaac Allerton was at the same time appointed
Assistant to the Governor.</p>

<p>After a summer and autumn of prosperous labor and harvest, they were
cheered, November 11/21, by the arrival of the “Fortune” from London,
bringing as a visitor Robert Cushman, their former associate, and thirty-five
additions to their feeble number, twenty-five of them adult males,&mdash;the
majority, however, not from Leyden. The ship brought also a patent,
granted June 1/11,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> by the President and Council of New England&mdash;within
whose territory the new settlement lay&mdash;to the same John Peirce and his
associates in whose names the merchants fathering this venture had secured
a patent the year before from the Virginia Company for the use of
the “Mayflower” colonists. Without fixing territorial limits, the new grant
allowed a hundred acres to be taken up for every emigrant, with fifteen
hundred acres for public buildings, and empowered the grantees to make
laws and set up a government.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By the delivery of this patent a sufficient show of authority was conferred
for immediate need and for eight and a half years to come. It is
true that in April, 1622, Peirce obtained surreptitiously for his private use
a new grant with additional privileges, to be valid in place of the grant
just described; but the trick was soon discovered, and the associates were
reinstated by the Plymouth Company in their rights.</p>

<p>Taking these eight and a half years under the first patent as a separate
period, the progress made in them may be briefly stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The settlement is first called “New Plymouth” in a letter sent back to
England by the “Fortune” in December, 1621, and printed in the second
edition of Captain John Smith’s <i>New England’s Trials</i>, in 1622. That it was
so called may have been suggested as much by the name Plymouth on
Smith’s map of this region (1614) as by the departure of the “Mayflower”
from Plymouth, England, or by the knowledge that the colony was the first
within the limits of the newly incorporated Plymouth Company. Later,
the town was called simply Plymouth, while the colony retained the name
New Plymouth.</p>

<p>In numbers they increased from less than fifty at the arrival of the
“Fortune,” to near three hundred on the reception of the second charter
in May, 1630. The most important accessions were in July, 1623,&mdash;about
sixty persons, a few of them from Leyden; and about as many more&mdash;all
from Leyden&mdash;in 1629-30.</p>

<p>In the second year at New Plymouth, because of threats from the Narragansett
tribe of Indians about Narragansett Bay, the town was enclosed with
a strong palisade, and a substantial fort (used also on Sundays as a meeting-house)
was erected on the hill which formed so conspicuous a feature
of the enclosure. The mode of life which John Smith described in his
<i>Generall Historie</i> in 1624,&mdash;that “the most of them live together as one
family or household, yet every man followeth his trade and profession both
by sea and land, and all for a general stock, out of which they have all their
maintenance,”&mdash;was modified the same year, to the great advantage of all, by
the assignment to each head of a family of an acre of ground for planting,
to be held as his own till the division of profits with the London merchants.
While this taste of proprietorship tended to increase the restlessness of the
planters, the vanishing prospect of large returns was simultaneously disheartening
the “merchant adventurers,” so that many withdrew, and the remainder
agreed to a termination of the partnership, in consideration of the
payment of £1,800, in nine equal annual instalments, beginning in 1628.
This arrangement was effected in London in November, 1626, through
Isaac Allerton, one of the younger of the original Leyden emigrants, who
had been commissioned for the purpose; and to meet the new financial
situation, the resident adult males (except a few thought unworthy of confidence)
were constituted stockholders, each one being allowed shares up
to the number of his family. Then followed an allotment of land to each
shareholder, the settlement of the title of each to the house he occupied,
and a distribution of the few cattle on hand among groups of families,&mdash;all
these possessions having hitherto been the joint, undivided stock of the
“merchant adventurers” and the planters. At the same time eight leading
planters (Bradford, Standish, Allerton, Winslow, Brewster, Howland,
Alden, and Prince), with the help of four London friends, undertook to
meet the outstanding obligations of the colony and the first six annual
payments on the new basis, obtaining in return a monopoly of the foreign
trade.</p>

<p>In these arrangements, which proved eminently wise for the public interests,
one object was to facilitate further emigration from Leyden. The
management of the London merchants had been unfavorable to this end,
and it was a special grief
that during this period
of delay the beloved pastor,
Robinson, had ended
his life in Leyden,&mdash;Feb.
19 (March 1), 1625. The
heavy expenses of transporting
and providing for
such as came over in
1629-30 were cheerfully
borne by the new management.</p>

<p>The same temper in the
London merchants which
had hindered Robinson’s
coming,&mdash;a conviction
that the religious peculiarities
of the Pilgrims
interfered with the attractiveness
and financial
success of the colony,&mdash;led
them to send over in
1624 a minister of their
own choosing (John Lyford),
who was not merely
not in sympathy with the wants of the Plymouth men, but even tried to
serve his patrons by false accusations and by attempting to set up the
Church of England form of worship. He was expelled from the colony
within a year from his arrival, and the church continued under Elder
Brewster’s teaching. In 1628 Mr. Allerton on a voyage from England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
without direction from the church, brought over another minister, but mental
derangement quickly ended his career.</p>

<p>The colony began within these first years to enlarge its outlook. In 1627,
to further their maritime interests, an outpost was established on Buzzard’s
Bay, twenty miles to the southward; in the same year relations of friendly
commerce were entered into with the Dutch of New Amsterdam, and as
soon as the nearer plantations of the Massachusetts Company were begun,
Plymouth was prompt to aid and counsel as occasion offered. In 1628 the
attempt was made to establish more firmly the existing trade with the
Eastern Indians, by obtaining a patent for a parcel of land on the River
Kennebec.</p>

<p>These outside experiences were all in the way of encouragements: the
most serious annoyances came, not directly from the savages, but from
neighbors of their own blood. Thus in 1623 the wretched colonists sent
out the year before by Thomas Weston to Weymouth, twenty miles northwest
from Plymouth, had to be protected from their own mismanagement
and the hostility of the natives, by which means came about the first shedding
of Indian blood by the Pilgrims; and thus again, five years later, the
unruly nest of Morton’s followers at Merry Mount, just beyond Weymouth,
had to be broken up by force.</p>

<p>Of the progress of civil government in this first period we have scanty
memorials. Few laws and few officials answered the simple needs of the
colony. Bradford was annually elected governor, and in 1624, at his desire,
a board of five Assistants was substituted for the single Assistant who had
hitherto shared the executive responsibility. The people met from time to
time in General Court for the transaction of public business, and in 1623 a
book of laws was begun; but three pages sufficed to contain the half-dozen
simple enactments of the next half-dozen years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The next period of the colony history extends from Jan. 13/23, 1629-30,
when the Council for New England granted to Bradford, his heirs, associates,
and assigns, a useful enlargement of the patent for Plymouth and Kennebec,
to March 2/12, 1640-41, when Bradford in the name of the grantees
conveyed the rights thus bestowed to the freemen of New Plymouth in
their corporate capacity.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The most striking feature of this period was the growth from a single
plantation to a province of eight towns, seven of them stretching for fifty
miles along the shore of Cape Cod Bay, from Scituate to Yarmouth,
and Taunton lying twenty-five miles inland,&mdash;in all containing about
twenty-five hundred souls. With this growth there was also some extension
of trade on the Kennebec and Penobscot, and in 1632 a beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of exploration, and in 1633 of settlement, in the Connecticut Valley;
but the appearance of numerous emigrants from Massachusetts Bay defeated
the contemplated removal of the entire colony to the last-named
location.</p>

<p>The establishment of towns led necessarily to a more elaborate system
of civil government, and in 1636 it was found expedient to revise and codify
the previous enactments of the General Court, and to prescribe the duties
of the various public officers. In 1638 the inconveniences of governing by
mass-meeting led to the introduction of the representative system already
familiar to Massachusetts Bay. The number of Assistants had been increased
in 1633 from five to seven.</p>

<p>In 1629 an acceptable minister of the gospel&mdash;Ralph Smith, a Cambridge
graduate&mdash;for the first time took charge of the church in Plymouth;
and by 1641 the eight towns of the colony were all (except Marshfield,
which was but just settled) supplied with educated clergy, of whom perhaps
the most influential was Ralph Partridge, of Duxbury.</p>

<p>The half-century (1641-91) which completed the separate existence of
Plymouth Colony, witnessed no radical changes, but a steady development
under the existing patent, though repeated but unsuccessful attempts
were made to obtain a charter direct from the English Government. At
the outset (in 1641), by a purchase of the remaining interests of the English
partners of 1627, the last trace of dependence on foreign capital was
wiped out.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the discontinuance of English emigration after 1640,
and the enormous devastation of Philip’s war in 1675-76, the population
of the colony increased to about eight thousand in these fifty years, being
distributed through twenty towns, of which Scituate had probably the
largest numbers and certainly the most wealth, the town of Plymouth having
lost, even as early as 1643, its former prominence. That this growth
was no greater, and that expansion beyond the strict colony limits was
completely checked, resulted inevitably from the more favorable situation
of the neighboring colony of the Bay.</p>

<p>The civil administration continued as before, the Governor’s Assistants
and the Deputies sitting in General Court as one body. Deputies were
elected in each town by the resident freemen, the freemen being the original
signers of the compact on board the “Mayflower,” with such persons as had
been added to their number by a majority vote of the general court. Public
sentiment was so trustworthy that no qualifications were named for the
estate of freemen until 1656, when it was merely provided that a candidate
must have been approved by the freemen of his own town. Two years
later, when the colony was overrun by Quaker propagandists, persons of
that faith, as well as all others who similarly opposed the laws and the
established worship, were distinctly excluded from the privileges of freemen,
and in the new revision of the laws in 1671 freemen were obliged to
be at least twenty-one years of age, “of sober and peaceable conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
orthodox in the fundamentals of religion,” and possessed of at least £20
worth of ratable estate in the colony. By the Code of 1671 a Court of
Assistants was created to exercise the judicial functions hitherto retained
by the General Court; but in 1685, with the constitution of three counties,
most of these duties were transferred to county courts.</p>

<p>Two interdependent circumstances conspired with the poverty of the
settlers and the unattractiveness of the soil,&mdash;even as compared with Massachusetts
Bay,&mdash;to retard seriously the progress of the colony; and these
were, their inability to keep up a learned ministry, and the enforced delay
in providing for public education. The first of these facts was so patent
as to call forth public rebukes from Massachusetts, and it may be enough
to recall that in 1641 seven of the eight townships constituting the colony
were served by ministers of English education; but in the next half-century
these same pulpits stood vacant on the average upwards of ten years each,
and the new towns which were formed in the colony had no larger amount
of ministerial service. As to the other point, it is sufficient to note that
neither from tradition nor from public records is there evidence of any
opportunity or provision for education before 1670,&mdash;except, of course,
in the private family. Their poverty no doubt chiefly occasioned this.</p>

<p>Yet while the resources of Plymouth and the education of her public men
were distinctly inferior to those of the Bay, she bore herself in her relations
with the other colonies with a certain simple dignity and straightforward
reasonableness which won respect; and in matters of general interest she
was content to share the sentiments of her comrades without controlling
them. She joined in the New England Confederation of 1643; and though
the idea sprang from another quarter, it is probable that the form was influenced
by suggestions from the Plymouth men, derived from their experience
in the United Netherlands.</p>

<p>Plymouth’s treatment of the Quakers, in 1656 and the following years,
illustrated in part the contrast with Massachusetts Bay. At the outset
public sentiment was much the same in the two colonies, in view of the
extravagances and indecencies of these intruders; but the greater mildness
of administration in Plymouth bore its appropriate fruit in lessening the
evil characteristics which developed by opposition, and gradually the dreaded
sectaries gained a foothold, until finally their principles were widely adopted
in certain localities with only good results.</p>

<p>Plymouth’s treatment of the Royal Commissioners in 1665 indicated
fairly her consistent attitude towards the mother country; in receiving the
King’s mandates with respect, and in promising conformity, she held the
course which had produced the seven articles at Leyden in 1617.</p>

<p>The most serious misfortune to visit the colony was the Indian war which
broke out early in 1675. Up to that time the Plymouth men had been
careful to acquire by <i>bonâ fide</i> purchase a title to all new lands as they were
occupied; they had endeavored also (with fair success, as compared with
like efforts in Massachusetts Bay) to spread the knowledge of Christianity;
and in 1675 there were perhaps six or seven hundred “praying Indians”
within the colony bounds.</p>

<p>But Wamsutta and Metacomet (otherwise Alexander
and Philip), the sons and successors of the sachem Massasoit, were
hostile to the whites and unaffected by Christian influences; and after
Alexander’s death, in 1662, the colonists found that only by constant
watchfulness could they prevent a breach with the savages. Finally under
Philip’s lead they rose
and began a war of extermination.
The exciting
cause and the earliest
operations were within
the territory claimed by
Plymouth; on her fell
successively the heaviest
blows (in proportion to
her population) and the
most pressing responsibilities
for defence.
When the war ended
with Philip’s death, in
August, 1676, more than
half her towns had been
partially or wholly destroyed,
and the colony’s
share (about £15,000) of
the expense incurred by
the New England Confederacy
in suppressing
the Indians was a very
serious burden on a feeble agricultural community. Before the slow process
of recovery from these desolations could be accomplished, the ancient customs
of self-government were invaded by James II.; and when the arbitrary
exactions under Andros, as Governor of all New England, were ended
in the Revolution of 1689, the return to the old conditions of freedom was
but temporary; the new monarchs followed James’s policy of consolidation,
and Plymouth found herself fated to be included either in the charter of
New York or in that of Massachusetts. Better a known than an unknown
evil; and accordingly the London agent of Plymouth was authorized to
express a preference for union with Boston, and the provincial charter of
Massachusetts in October, 1691, put an end to the separate existence of the
colony of New Plymouth. Of the original “Mayflower” company but two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
members survived,&mdash;John Cooke, of Dartmouth, who died in 1695, and
Mary (Allerton) Cushman, of Plymouth, who died in 1699. The younger
generation were accustomed to the leadership of Massachusetts Bay, and
accepted the union as a natural and fitting step.</p>

<h3><a name="c283" id="c283">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest printed volume treating of the origin of Plymouth Colony was <i>New
England’s Memorial; ... with special Reference to the first Colony thereof</i>, published
by Nathaniel Morton in 1669. As he states in his “Epistle Dedicatory,” the most
of his intelligence concerning the beginnings of the settlement came from manuscripts left
by his “much-honored uncle, Mr. William Bradford.” Morton’s parents had emigrated
in 1623, when he was a boy of ten, from Leyden to Plymouth, with a younger sister of Mrs.
Morton, who had been sent for to become the wife of Governor Bradford. This connection
and his own position as secretary of the General Court of the Colony from 1645, gave
peculiar opportunities for gathering information; but his book preserves nothing on the
earliest portion of the Pilgrim history, beyond the date (1602) and the place (“the North

<p>The manuscripts of Governor Bradford passed at his death (1657) to his eldest son,
Major William Bradford, of Plymouth, and while in his possession a few particulars were
extracted for Cotton Mather’s use in his <i>Magnalia</i> (1702), especially in the “Life of Bradford”
(book ii. chap. i.). A minute, but very efficient typographical error, however
(A<i>n</i>sterfield for A<i>u</i>sterfield), kept students for the next century and a half out of the
knowledge of Governor Bradford’s birthplace, and of the exact neighborhood whence
came the Leyden migration. From Major William Bradford, who died in 1704, the manuscripts
descended to his son, Major John, of Kingston (originally a part of Plymouth), by
whom the most precious were lent or given, in 1728, to the Rev. Thomas Prince, of Boston.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Prince made a careful use of this material in the first volume of his <i>Annals</i> (1736), fixing
the locality whence the Pilgrims came as “near the joining borders of Nottinghamshire,
Linconshire, and Yorkshire,” and lodged the originals in the library which he bequeathed,
in 1758, to the Old South Church in Boston. Governor Thomas Hutchinson, while writing
his <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i>, found these manuscripts in the Prince Library, and
printed in the Appendix to his second volume (1767) a valuable extract describing the
exodus to Holland. In the troublous times which followed, the Bradford papers disappeared.</p>

<p>Another extract from Bradford, however, soon after came to light in the records of
the First Church in Plymouth, where Secretary Morton had transcribed, in 1680, most
of his uncle’s account of the transatlantic history of the Pilgrims. This was printed,
in part and somewhat inaccurately, by Ebenezer Hazard, in vol. i. of his <i>Historical
Collections</i> (1792), and in full by the Rev. Alexander Young, in his <i>Chronicles of the
Pilgrims</i> (1841).</p>

<p>The clews furnished by Mather and Prince to the Pilgrim cradle-land attracted no
special attention until 1842, when the Hon. James Savage, during a visit to England,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
submitted the problem to the Rev. Joseph Hunter, author of a history of South Yorkshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of which region he was also a native. Mr. Hunter, though the evidence was incomplete,
suggested that Austerfield was the place wanted; and the attention of this
accomplished antiquary being thus enlisted, the result appeared in a tract, published by
him in 1849, entitled <i>Collections concerning the Founders of New Plymouth</i>, which identified
the meeting-place of the Separatist Church before their removal to Holland. This
tract was reissued, in 1852, in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. xxxi., and again in London,
in an enlarged form, in 1854.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The author’s careful examination of local records made
plain the position of the Brewsters in Scrooby, and of the Bradfords in Austerfield (with
the entry of Governor Bradford’s baptism), and traced their families, as well as the families
of other early members of the Scrooby flock, in the neighboring parishes. The importance
of Mr. Hunter’s labors may be seen in the fact, that, besides Brewster and Bradford,
none of the “Mayflower” passengers (except the two Winslows) have even yet been surely
traced to an English birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hunter’s success soon attracted the attention of other investigators. The earliest
visit to Scrooby which has received notice in print was one made in July, 1851, by the Rev.
Henry M. Dexter, of Boston, described by him in <i>The Congregationalist</i> of Aug. 8, 1851.
Mr. W. H. Bartlett’s <i>Pilgrim Fathers</i>, p. 35, published in 1853, added nothing to Hunter’s
researches, except some interesting engravings of the church in which Bradford was baptized,
and of Scrooby village. In his enlarged edition of 1854, Hunter gave a better view
of the remains of the palace inhabited by Brewster. Mr. Palfrey visited the neighborhood
in 1856, and records his impressions in a note on p. 134 of vol. i. (1858) of his
<i>History of New England</i>. In 1860 the Rev. John Raine, vicar of the parish of Blyth, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
which these hamlets were formerly included, printed a valuable account of that parish’s
history and antiquities.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1862, the Rev. H. M. Dexter published, in the <i>Congregational Quarterly</i>,
an article on “Recent Discoveries concerning the Plymouth Pilgrims,” summarizing conveniently
what had been learned regarding the place where, and the time when, the church
was gathered. In March, 1867, he contributed to the <i>Sabbath at Home</i> magazine an illustrated
article on the “Footprints of the Pilgrims in England,” which is still the most vivid
and the fullest description extant of the Scrooby neighborhood. With this should be compared,
for additional facts, a letter from Dr. Dexter in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (xii. 129)
for July, 1871; the early pages of the chapter on Robinson, in the same author’s <i>Congregationalism
as seen in its Literature</i> (1880); and the record of a visit in 1860, in Professor
James M. Hoppin’s <i>Old England</i>. The Scrooby episode is also told, more or less fully,
in the Rev. Ashbel Steele’s <i>Life of Elder Brewster</i> (1857), in Dr. John Waddington’s
<i>Track of the Hidden Church</i> (1863), and in chap. vi. of the second volume of his <i>Congregational
History</i> (1874), in the Rev. George Punchard’s <i>History of Congregationalism</i>, vol.
iii. chap. xi. (1867), in chap. vii. of vol. ii. of S. R. Gardiner’s <i>Prince Charles and the Spanish
Marriage</i> (1869), and in chap. x. of Dr. Leonard Bacon’s <i>Genesis of the New England
Churches</i> (1874).<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Scrooby village is about one hundred and forty miles N.N.W. from London, and eighty
miles due east from Liverpool. It lies on the Great Northern Railway; but as its population
numbers only some two hundred, it is practically a mere suburb of Bawtry, a small
market-town a mile and a quarter to the north, of perhaps a thousand inhabitants. Austerfield,
a little larger than Scrooby, and at about the same distance from Bawtry in a
northeasterly direction, is included, as well as much of the other two localities, in the
patrimony of Lord Houghton (Richard Monckton Milnes), whose family have held it since
1779.</p>

<p class="p2">Of the life in Holland and the preparations for removal to America, the first connected
account in print was that appended by Edward Winslow (who had joined the company at
Leyden in 1617, at the age of twenty-two) to his <i>Hypocrisy Unmasked</i>, in 1646, which was
reprinted in 1841, in Dr. Young’s <i>Chronicles of the Pilgrims</i>. Winslow’s object in this
brief appendix was to refute an unjust charge of schism in the Leyden church, and to
explain the reasons for the removal and the course of the accompanying negotiations; he
also reviewed Robinson’s doctrinal position, and incidentally preserved the substance of
the pastor’s farewell address to the departing portion of his flock.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Morton’s <i>Memorial</i>,
in 1669, gave from Bradford’s manuscripts a fuller account of the events in question; and
Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> (1702), and Prince’s <i>Annals</i> (1736), added a few touches to the picture.
Prince has also the distinction of being the first of those who have retraced the
steps of the Pilgrims on Dutch soil, his <i>Annals</i> (vol. i. p. 160) recording his visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Leyden in 1714, and his supposed identification of the church which Robinson’s congregation
used, and in which he was buried.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>The extracts from Bradford published by Hazard in 1792, with those included in the
notes to Judge John Davis’s edition of Morton’s <i>Memorial</i> in 1826, all of which were
reprinted by Dr. Young in 1841, set forth in a more orderly way the story of the removal.
But there was no inquiry in Holland until Leyden was visited by Mr. George Sumner, a
younger brother of Senator Sumner, who communicated the results of his researches to
the Massachusetts Historical Society, in 1843, in a paper which was published separately
at Cambridge in 1845, and in the Society’s <i>Collections</i>, vol. xxix. (1846). Mr. Sumner
threw much light on the actual condition of the Pilgrims in Holland, while investigating
Prince’s report of a church lent them by the city, and Winslow’s account of the respect
paid Robinson at his funeral. He showed that Prince had confused this congregation
with one founded contemporaneously by English Presbyterians in Leyden, for whose use
a chapel was granted, while Robinson’s company received no such favor. He also
printed the record of Robinson’s admission to the University,&mdash;a fact not before recovered,&mdash;and
the entry of his burial in St. Peter’s cathedral, just across the way from his
house.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>In 1848 another item of interest,&mdash;the application of Robinson and his people for leave
to come to Leyden,&mdash;was printed for the first time in a <i>Memoir of Robinson</i>, by Professor
Kist, in vol. viii. of the <i>Nederlandsch Archief voor Kerkelijke Geschiedenis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> A fuller
memoir, prefixed to a collected edition of his writings, was published in London three
years later (1851), by the Rev. Robert Ashton, and reprinted in the <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
vol. xli. (1852).</p>

<p>Next in chronological order comes the publication of the most important of all known
sources of information respecting the Pilgrims from 1608 to 1646,&mdash;the <i>History of Plymouth
Plantation</i>, by William Bradford, second governor of the colony. We have seen
that this history was used, in manuscript, by various writers, but disappeared after 1767.
In 1844 a <i>History of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America</i>, by the Bishop of
Oxford (Dr. Samuel Wilberforce), was published in London, in which quotations embodying
new information were made from an otherwise unknown “Manuscript History of the
Plantation of Plymouth, etc., in the Fulham Library.” The Bishop’s volume passed to
a second edition in 1846, and was reprinted in New York in 1849; while in 1848 there
appeared in London the Rev. J. S. M. Anderson’s <i>History of the Colonial Church</i>, in which
reference was distinctly made to “Bradford’s MS. History of Plymouth Colony ... now
in the possession of the Bishop of London.” But the significance of these allusions was
ignored by American students, until February, 1855, when Mr. John Wingate Thornton,
of Boston, called the attention of the Rev. John S. Barry, who was then engaged on the
first volume of his <i>History of Massachusetts</i>, to the Bishop of Oxford’s book. Taking
up the clew thus given, Mr. Barry conferred with Mr. Charles Deane, who sent at once to
London for information, and by the replies received, was enabled to announce at the meeting
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, April 12, 1855, that the complete manuscript
of Governor Bradford’s history had been found in the Library of the Bishop of London’s
Palace at Fulham, and that an accurate copy had been ordered for the Society’s use. This
transcript reached Boston in August, and was issued, under Mr. Deane’s able editorship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in the spring of 1856, both as a separate publication and as volume xxxiii. of the Society’s
<i>Collections</i>.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>How the manuscript came to be in the Fulham Library is uncertain; most probably
it was taken from the Prince Library, upon the evacuation of Boston by the British in
March, 1776, and was preserved and finally deposited in a public collection by those who
perceived it to be of value. The desirability of its return to America has been repeatedly
suggested; but as an individual bishop has no power to alienate the property of his See,
nothing has yet been accomplished.</p>

<p>The next special contribution to the history of the Pilgrims in Holland was the publication
of the “Seven Articles which the church of Leyden sent [in September, 1617] to
the Council of England, to be considered of in respect of their judgments occasioned about
their going to Virginia, anno 1618.” A contemporary transcript of this paper was found
in the British State-Paper Office by the Hon. George Bancroft, and communicated by him,
with an introductory letter, to the New York Historical Society, in October, 1856. It was
included, in 1857, in vol. iii. of the second series of their <i>Collections</i>.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>In 1859-60 the Hon. Henry C. Murphy, of Brooklyn, N. Y., United States Minister
at the Hague from 1857 to 1861, published in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i> (iii. 261, 335, 357; iv. 4) a
series of four “Contributions to the History of the Pilgrim Fathers, from the Records at
Leyden.” These valuable papers presented much new information (derived especially
from the marriage records) as to the full names, ages, occupations, and English homes of
Robinson’s congregation; they determined also the site and dimensions of his house, and
the details of its purchase. Another fact, which was already known, that Elder Brewster
during the last three years of his stay in Leyden was a printer and publisher, especially of
books on ecclesiastical matters, both in Latin and English,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> which it would not have been
safe to print at home, received new illustration from Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The labors of Sumner and Murphy in Holland have been supplemented by the diligent
researches of Dr. H. M. Dexter, whose work at Scrooby was mentioned above. In the
<i>Congregational Quarterly</i> for January, 1862 (vol. iv.), he gave an account of the recent additions
to our knowledge; and in the notes to his invaluable addition of <i>Mourt’s Relation</i>,
in 1865, he traced the personal history of the Pilgrims, so far as an exhaustive examination
of the Leyden records made that possible. In 1866, in company with Professor George E.
Day, of Yale College, who had shared in the previous investigations, Dr. Dexter superintended
the erection of a marble tablet, with appropriate inscription, on the front of the
Home for Aged Walloons, which now occupies the site of Robinson’s house. In the
<i>Sabbath at Home</i> for April, 1867, he published a graphic account of the “Footprints of
the Pilgrims in Holland,” and in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> for January, 1872 (xii. 184),
suggested some valuable corrections of Mr. Sumner’s Memoirs, respecting Robinson’s
death and burial. The Leyden pastor’s influence and doctrinal position may be best
studied in Dr. Dexter’s <i>Congregationalism as seen in its Literature</i> (1880), and in vol. iii.
of the Rev. George Punchard’s <i>History of Congregationalism</i> (2d ed. 1867).<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>For various contributions to fuller knowledge than Bradford affords of the negotiations
in London, after removal to America had been decided on, great credit is due to the
researches of the Rev. Edward D. Neill, especially in his <i>History of the Virginia Company</i>
(1869) and his <i>English Colonization of America</i> (1871). Cf. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xiii. 278.
The same writer has investigated the personal history of Captain Thomas Jones, master
of the “Mayflower,” in the <i>Historical Magazine</i> (January, 1869), xv. 31-33, and in the
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i> (1874), xxviii. 314-17. The charge that Jones was bribed
by the Dutch in 1620, is considered by Mr. William Brigham in the volume of lectures
published by the Massachusetts Historical Society on the <i>Early History of Massachusetts</i>,
and in the Society’s <i>Proceedings</i> for December, 1868.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>For the colony’s affairs from the sailing of the “Mayflower” to 1646, the prime source
of knowledge is Bradford’s <i>History</i>. At the time of emigrating, the author was in his
thirty-first year, and his book was written at various dates, from 1630
to 1650, when he was from forty to sixty years of age. Less than
four months after landing he became Governor, and for the remaining
quarter-century covered by his <i>History</i> he held the same office, except
during five years, when excused at his own urgent request. The foremost
man in the colony for this long period, nature and opportunity
equally fitted him to be its chronicler from the beginning. No one
could speak with more authority than he of the inner motives and
guiding policy of the original colonists,&mdash;fortunately, also, no one
could exemplify more clearly in written words the ideal Pilgrim than
does Bradford, with his grave, homely, earnest style, not unsuggestive
of the English of the Bible. Between his style and that of
Winthrop, the contemporary historian of the Bay, there is something
of the same difference that existed between the two emigrations;
and yet Bradford’s simple story, standing as it does as the earliest
piece of American historical composition, possesses a peculiar charm
which the broader, more philosophic page of Winthrop cannot rival.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The special contributions by others to the history of Bradford’s
period began in 1622 with the publication of <i>Mourt’s Relation</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
daily journal of the first twelve months (Sept. 1620, to Dec. 11, 1621), so called from the
name, “G. Mourt,” subscribed to the preface, but doubtless written by Bradford and
Winslow. The standard edition is that of 1865, with notes by Dr. H. M. Dexter.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> A
few facts may also be gleaned from a <i>Sermon</i> (by Robert Cushman) preached at Plymouth,
Dec. 9, 1621,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and from the second edition of Captain John Smith’s <i>New England’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Trials</i>,&mdash;both published in London in 1622. Winslow’s <i>Good News from New England</i>
appeared in 1624, continuing the narrative of events from November, 1621, to September
10, 1623.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Next came, after a long interval, <i>New
England’s Memorial</i>, by Nathaniel Morton, printed
at Cambridge in 1669, which professed to give the
annals of New England to 1668; beyond the part supplied from Bradford and Winslow,
however, there was little of value. Judge John Davis’s<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> edition of 1826 is still the best.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>To these materials the next sensible addition was in the “Summary of the Affairs of
the Colony of New-Plimouth,” appended, in 1767, to vol. ii. of Governor Hutchinson’s
<i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i>, and containing some personal items not before collected.
In 1794 a fragment of a letter-book, preserving copies of important letters written and
received by Governor Bradford from 1624 to 1630, having lately been found in Nova
Scotia, was printed in the <i>Massachusetts Historical Collections</i>, vol. iii.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> In 1798 Dr.
Jeremy Belknap included in vol. ii. of his <i>American Biography</i> sketches of the leading
Pilgrims (Robinson, Carver, Bradford, Brewster, Cushman, Winslow, and Standish), which
put in admirable form all then known of early Plymouth history.</p>

<p>The next quarter of a century added nothing to the existing stock of knowledge, unless
by the publication in 1815 of the <i>General History of New England</i> to 1680, by the Rev.
William Hubbard (born 1621, died 1704), which, so far as Plymouth was concerned, was
little more than a compilation from sources already named. But with the issue, in
1826, of a new edition of <i>Morton</i>, and in 1830 of <i>An Historical Memoir of the Colony of
New Plymouth</i>, by the Hon. Francis Baylies,<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and in 1832 of a <i>History of the Town of

<p>The Legislature of Massachusetts gave fresh impulse to this spirit of investigation by
publishing in 1836, under the editorship of Mr. William Brigham, the <i>Laws passed in
Plymouth Colony from 1623 to 1691</i>, with
a selection of other permanent documents.
In 1841 the Rev. Alexander Young<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> collected,
under the title of <i>Chronicles of the
Pilgrim Fathers from 1602 to 1625</i>, the
principal writings of that period, and, enriching
them with a body of useful notes,
made a volume which still retains a distinct
value. In 1846 and 1851 a local antiquary,
Mr. William S. Russell,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> brought out two
small volumes,&mdash;<i>A Guide to Plymouth</i> and
<i>Pilgrim Memorials</i>,&mdash;which are not yet
superseded; Mr. William H. Bartlett’s <i>Pilgrim
Fathers</i><a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> (1853) added something to
these local touches. Between 1855 and
1861 the <i>Records of the Colony of New
Plymouth</i> were printed <i>in extenso</i>, by order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the State Legislature, under the editorship of Dr. N. B. Shurtleff<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and Mr. David
Pulsifer.</p>

<p>The year 1856 was made memorable by the printing of Bradford’s manuscript, and
two years later appeared the initial volume of Dr. John G. Palfrey’s <i>History of New
England</i>, which comprehends by far the best of modern narratives of the complete career
of Plymouth Colony. Only in subsidiary literature have the more recent years added
anything. Valuable bibliographical notes on Pilgrim history, by the editor of the present
volume, were printed in the <i>Harvard College Library Bulletin</i> for 1878, nos. 7 and 8; and
the “Collections toward a Bibliography of Congregationalism,” appended to Dr. H. M.
Dexter’s <i>Congregationalism as seen in its Literature</i> (1880), are indispensable to future
students. In 1881 General E. W. Peirce published a useful volume of <i>Civil, Military,
and Professional Lists of Plymouth and Rhode Island Colonies</i> to 1700.</p>

<p>Apart from strictly historical composition, the theme has inspired some of the greatest
oratorical efforts of the sons of New England in the present century,&mdash;especially in connection
with the stated annual celebrations of the Pilgrim Society,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> formed at Plymouth in
1820 (a successor of the earlier Old Colony Club,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> founded in 1769). Most deservedly conspicuous
in this series are the orations delivered in 1820 by Daniel Webster, in 1824 by
Edward Everett, and in 1870 by Robert C. Winthrop; of similar note are several of the
orations before the New England Society of New York, founded in 1805. The Pilgrim
Society has also fostered local sentiment by erecting (in 1824) Pilgrim Hall in the town of
Plymouth, and by gathering within it a valuable collection of memorials of the early
settlers and of portraits of historical interest.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>A portrait of Edward Winslow (engraved on a previous page) is in Pilgrim Hall at
Plymouth, and is the only undoubted portrait of any of the Pilgrims now existing.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Of
the many attempts to depict on canvas signal events of Pilgrim history, the most important
is a painting by Robert W. Weir of the embarkation at Delft Haven, executed in
1846, and occupying one of the panels in the Rotunda of the Capitol at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
The most imposing works of architecture and sculpture in commemoration of the same
events are the canopy recently erected over the rock in Plymouth on which the Pilgrims
are believed to have landed, and the monument on a neighboring hill-top.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>In poetical literature the most serious and sustained effort to represent the Pilgrim
spirit is in Longfellow’s “Courtship of Miles Standish” (1859);<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> while in briefer compass
Old England, through Lord Houghton (Prefatory Stanzas to Hunter’s <i>Founders of New
Plymouth</i>) and Mrs. Hemans (“Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers”), and New England
through Pierpont (“The Pilgrim Fathers”) and Lowell (“Interview with Miles Standish”),
have vied in celebrating the character and deeds of the exiles of 1620.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">NEW ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY CHARLES DEANE, LL. D.,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Vice-President of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Council for New England.</span>&mdash;This body was incorporated in
the eighteenth year of the reign of James I., on the 3d of November,
1620, under the name of the “Council established at Plymouth, in the
County of Devon, for the planting, ruling, ordering, and governing of New
England, in America.” The corporation consisted of forty patentees, the
most of whom were persons of distinction: thirteen were peers, some
of the highest rank. The patentees were empowered to hold territory in
America extending from the fortieth to the forty-eighth degree of north
latitude, and westward from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and they were
authorized to settle and govern the same. This charter is the foundation
of most of the grants which were afterward made of the territory of
New England.</p>

<p>This Company was substantially a reincorporation of the adventurers or
associates of the Northern Colony of Virginia, with additional privileges,
placing them on a footing with their rivals of the Southern Colony, whose
franchise had been twice enlarged since the issuing of the original charter
of April 10, 1606, which incorporated both companies. A notice of this
earlier enterprise will but briefly detain us.</p>

<p>While the Southern Colony had attracted the wealth and influence of
leading adventurers who represented the more liberal party in the government,
and were enabled to prosecute their plans of colonization with vigor to
a good degree of success, the Northern Colony had signally failed from the
beginning. The former had established at Jamestown, in 1607, the first
permanent English Colony in America. The latter produced no greater
results than the abortive settlement at Sabino, known as the Popham
Colony.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> The discouragement following upon its abandonment prompted
the withdrawal of many of the adventurers, though the organization of the
patentees still survived; but of their meetings and records we have no
trace. Sir Ferdinando Gorges himself would not despair, but engaged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
private fortune in fishing, trading, and exploring expeditions, and in making
attempts at settlement. Many of these enterprises he speaks of as private
ventures, while the Council for New England, in their <i>Briefe Relation</i>, of
1622, which I have sometimes thought was written by Gorges himself,
speaks of them in the name of the Company. The probability is that
Gorges was the principal person who kept alive the cherished scheme of
settling the country, and by his influence a few other persons were engaged,
and the name of the Council covered many of these enterprises.</p>

<p class="p2">Gorges now conceived the scheme of a great monopoly. King James
had reigned since 1614 without a parliament, and during the following years
down to the meeting of the next parliament, in January, 1620/21, a large
part of the business of the country had been monopolized by individuals or
by associations that had secured special privileges from the Crown. Gorges
was a friend of the King and of the “prerogative.” Under the plea of
desiring a new incorporation of the adventurers of the Northern Colony, in
order to place them on an equality of privileges with the Southern Colony,
Gorges had devised the plan of securing a monoply of the fishing in the
waters of New England for the patentees of the new corporation, and for
those who held or purchased license from them. He had the adroitness to
enlist in his favor a large number of the principal noblemen and gentlemen.
Relative to his proceedings, Gorges himself says: “Of this, my resolution,
I was bold to offer the sounder considerations to divers of his Majesty’s
honorable Privy Council, who had so good liking thereunto as they willingly
became interested themselves therein as patentees and councillors for the
managing of the business, by whose favors I had the easier passage in the
obtaining his Majesty’s royal charter to be granted us according to his
warrant to the then solicitor-general,” etc. The petition for the new
charter was dated March 3, 1619/20; the warrant for its preparation, July
23; and it passed the seals Nov. 3, 1620.</p>

<p>An inspection of the several patents granted by King James will show
that, in those of 1606 and 1609, among the privileges conferred is that of
“fishings.” But the word is there used in connection with other privileges
appertaining to and within the precincts conveyed, such as “mines, minerals,
marshes,” etc., and probably meant “fishings” in rivers and ponds, and not
in the seas. In the patent of Nov. 3, 1620, a similar clause ends, “and seas
adjoining,” which may be intended to cover the alleged privilege. In this
patent, as in the others, there is no clause forbidding free fishing within the
seas of New England; but all persons without license first obtained from
the Council are, in the patent of Nov. 3, 1620, forbidden to visit the coast,
and the clause of forfeiture of vessel and cargo is inserted. This prevented
fishermen from landing and procuring wood for constructing stages to dry
their fish.</p>

<p>A few days after the petition of Gorges and his associates had been presented
to the King for a new charter, with minutes indicating the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the privileges asked for, the Southern Colony took the alarm, and the subject
was brought before its members by the treasurer, Sir Edwin Sandys,
at a meeting on the 15th of March, 1619/20, at which a committee was appointed
to appear before the Privy Council the next day, to protest against
the fishing monopoly asked for by the Northern Colony. The result of the
conference, at which Gorges was present, was a reference to two members
of the Council,&mdash;the Duke of Lenox and the Earl of Arundell, both patentees
in the new patent; and they decided or recommended that each colony
should fish within the bounds of the other, with this limitation,&mdash;“that it
be only for the sustentation of the people of the colonies there, and for the
transportation of people into either colony.” This order gave satisfaction
to neither party. The Southern Colony protested against being deprived
of privileges which they had always enjoyed. Gorges contended that the
Northern Colony had been excluded from the limits of the rival company,
and he only desired the same privilege of excluding them in turn. The
matter came again before the Privy Council on the 21st of July following,
and that board confirmed the recommendation of the 16th of March. Two
days later, on the 23d of July, the warrant to the solicitor-general for the
preparation of the patent was issued, and it passed the seals, as already
stated, on the 3d of November.</p>

<p>On the following day, November 4, Sir Edwin Sandys announced at a
meeting of the Southern Colony, or what was now known as the Virginia
Company, that the patent of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, containing certain
words which contradicted a former order of the Lords of the Council,
had passed the seals, and that the adventurers of the Northern Colony
by this grant had utterly excluded the Southern Colony from fishing
on that coast without their leave and license first sought and obtained.
By a general consent it was resolved to supplicate his Majesty for redress,
and Sir Thomas Roe was desired to present the petition which had been
drawn.</p>

<p>On the 13th Sir Thomas Roe reported that he had attended to that
duty, and that the King had said that if anything was passed in the New
England patent prejudicial to the Southern Colony, it was surreptitiously
done, and without his knowledge, and that he had been abused thereby by
those who pretended otherwise unto him. This was confirmed by the Earl
of Southampton, who further said that the King gave command to the Lord
Chamberlain, then present, that if this new patent were not sealed, to forbear
the seal; and if it were sealed and not delivered, to keep it in hand
till they were better informed. His Lordship further signified that on
Saturday last they had been with the Lord Chancellor about it, when were
present the Duke of Lenox, the Earl of Arundell, and others, who, after
hearing the allegations on both sides, ordered that the patent should be
delivered to be perused by some of the Southern Colony, who were to report
what exceptions they found thereunto against the next meeting. Two days
later it was announced through the Earl of Southampton that, at a recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
conference with Gorges, it was agreed that for the present “the patent of
Sir Ferdinando Gorges should be sequestered and deposited in my Lord
Chancellor’s hands according to his Majesty’s express command.”</p>

<p>The Council for New England, in their <i>Briefe Relation</i> (1622) of these
proceedings, recounting the opposition of the Virginia Company, say that
“lastly, the patent being passed the seal, it was stopped, upon new suggestions
to the King, and by his Majesty referred to the Council to be settled,
by whom the former orders were confirmed, the difference cleared, and we
ordered to have our patent delivered us.”</p>

<p>The modifications suggested or directed by the Privy Council appear
not to have been embodied in the instrument itself as it passed the seals.
Gorges’ friends were very strong in the council board, some of the members
being patentees in the grant, and they carried matters with a high
hand. But before the order came for the final delivery of the patent,
Gorges and his patentees were called to encounter a still more formidable
opposition. Gorges himself tells us that his rivals had plainly told him
that “howsoever I had sped before the Lords, I should hear more of it
the next Parliament;” and that this body was no sooner assembled than
he found it too true wherewith he had been formerly threatened.</p>

<p>The Parliament met Jan. 16, 1620/21, it being the first time for more
than seven years, and at once adjourned to the 30th of that month. On
its assembling, the House of Commons immediately proceeded to present
the public grievances of the kingdom, prominent among which were the
monopolies that had sprung up like hydras during the last few years under
the royal prerogative. On the 17th of April “An Act for the freer
liberty of fishing voyages, to be made and performed on the sea-coast and
places of Newfoundland, Virginia, New England, and other the sea-coasts
and parts of America,” was introduced. On the 25th this was repeated, and
a debate followed, opened by Sir Edwin Sandys, who called attention to
the new grant obtained for what had now come to be called New England,
with a sole privilege of fishing; also to the fact that the King, who had been
made acquainted with it, had stayed the patent; that the Virginia Company
desired no appropriation of this fishing to them; that it was worth one
hundred thousand pounds per annum in coin; that the English “little frequent
this, in respect of this prohibition, but the Dutch and French.” He
therefore moved for “a free liberty for all the King’s subjects for fishing
there,” saying it was pitiful that any of the King’s subjects should be prohibited,
since the French and Dutch were at liberty to come and fish there
notwithstanding the colony.</p>

<p>The debate was continued. Secretary Calvert “doubteth the fishermen
the hinderers of the plantation; that they burn great store of woods, and
choke the havens;” that he “never will strain the King’s prerogative against
the good of the commonwealth;” and that it was “not fit to make any
laws here for those countries which not as yet annexed to the Crown.”</p>

<p>The bill was committed to Sir Edwin Sandys, and a full hearing advertized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to all burgesses of London, York, and the port towns, who might wish
to testify, that day seven-night, in the Exchequer Chamber.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June Parliament adjourned to the 14th of November, and
in the intermission Sir Edwin Sandys was arrested and thrown into prison.
It is significant that, notwithstanding this opposition in the House of Commons,
the Privy Council, on the 18th, ordered that the sequestered patent
be delivered to Gorges, in terms which provided that each colony (the
Northern and the Southern) should have the additional freedom of the
shore for the drying of their nets and the taking and saving of their fish, and
to have wood for their necessary uses, etc.; also that the patent of the
Northern plantation be renewed according to the premises, while those of
the Southern plantation were to have a sight thereof before it be engrossed,
and that the former patent be delivered to the patentees.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that the orders of the Privy Council early
directed certain modifications to be made in the proposed patent which
were not embodied in it when first drawn; nor were they ultimately included,
although Gorges himself admitted, when afterward summoned
before the Committee of the House of Commons, that the patent yet
remained in the Crown office, “where it was left since the last Parliament”
(he meant, since the last session of Parliament), “for that it
was resolved to be renewed for the amendment of some faults contained
therein.”</p>

<p>No doubt the intention was that a new patent should be drawn, and that
the delivery of the existing parchment was provisional only.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The patent,
however, never was renewed, though a scheme for a renewal of a most
radical character was seriously contemplated all through the year following
the dissolution of the Parliament in 1622; and Sir Henry Spelman and
John Selden were consulted in regard to land tenures, the rights of the
Crown, and the like, in reference thereto.</p>

<p>On the reassembling of Parliament in November, the subject was once
again approached in the Commons. It was charged that since the recess
Gorges had executed a patent. One had been issued, dated June 1, 1621,
to John Peirce for the Plymouth people. He had also, by patent or by
verbal agreement, by the King’s request, released to Sir William Alexander
all the land east of St. Croix, known as Nova Scotia, confirmed to him by
a royal charter September 10 of this year.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> It was also charged that
Gorges was threatening to use force in restricting the right to fish; and
accordingly on the 20th an order was passed directing his patent to be
brought in to the Committee on Grievances.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The result was that on the 21st of December an Act for freer liberty of
fishing passed the Commons, while previously, on the 18th, “Sir Ferdinando
Gorges and Sir Jo. Bowcer, the patentees for fishing in and about
New England, to be warned to appear here the first day of next Access,
and to bring their patent, or a copy thereof.” Parliament then adjourned
to the 8th of February; but it was subsequently prorogued and dissolved.
Before the adjournment, in the afternoon, the Commons, foreseeing their
dissolution, entered on their records a protestation in vindication of their
rights and privileges; but the record is here mutilated by having the obnoxious
passage torn out by the hands of the King, who sent for the
Journal of the House and placed this mark of his tyranny upon it. Gorges
himself, at this session of the Parliament, twice appeared before the Committee
of the House, and had a preliminary examination without his counsel.
He was questioned by Sir Edward Coke about his patent, which Coke
called a grievance of the commonwealth, and complained of as “a monopoly,
and the color of planting a colony put upon it for particular ends and
private gain.” Gorges says he was treated with great courtesy, but was
told that “the Public was to be respected before all particulars,” and that
the patent must be brought into the House. Gorges replied by defending
the plan of the adventurers, which he said was undertaken for the advancement
of religion, the enlargement of the bounds of the nation, the increase
of trade, and the employment of many thousands of people. He rehearsed
what had already been done in the discovery and seizure of the coast, told
of the failures and discouragements encountered, and explained the present
scheme of regulating the affairs of the intended plantation for the public
good. As for the delivery of the patent, he had not the power to do it
himself, as he was but a particular person, and inferior to many. Besides,
the patent still remained, for aught he knew, in the Crown Office, where it
was left for amendment. He was then told to be prepared to attend further
at a future day, and with counsel. In the end, also, the breaking up of Parliament
prevented the bill for free fishing, which had passed the Commons,
from becoming a law.</p>

<p>Of course, the opposition encountered&mdash;first from the Virginia Company
and then from the House of Commons, the latter representing largely the
popular sentiment&mdash;was a serious hindrance to the operations of the Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
for New England. The disputes with the former, the Council themselves
say, “held them almost two years, so as all men were afraid to join with
them.”</p>

<p>The records of the Council, so far as they are extant, begin on “Saturday,
the last of May, 1622,” at “Whitehall,” at which there were seven
persons present, “the Lord Duke of Lenox” heading the list. Some
business was transacted before this date, as the first day’s record here refers
to it. The record of the organization of the Council is wanting; and two
persons named as present at this meeting&mdash;Captain Samuel Argall and
Dr. Barnabe Goche&mdash;were not included in the list of the forty patentees.
They must have been elected since, in the place of others who had resigned.
Goche was now elected treasurer in the place of Sir Ferdinando Gorges.
I think that the Duke of Lenox was the first president of the Council. In
the patent granted to John Peirce, mentioned above as taken out on behalf
of the Pilgrims, dated June 1, 1621,&mdash;which, I may add, was nearly a year
before the date of any known record of the Council,&mdash;purporting to be
signed by “the President and Counsell,” who have “set their seals” to the
same, were the names of Lenox, Hamilton, Ro. Warwick, Sheffield, Ferd.
Gorges, in the order here given, and one other name indistinct, with their
separate seals.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>It is not improbable, therefore, that the business transactions of the
Council, in this inchoate and uncertain period of its existence, were so few
that they were preserved only in loose minutes, or files of papers, which
were never recorded, and are now lost.</p>

<p>After they had freed their patent, they first considered how they should
raise the means to advance the plantation, and two methods were suggested.
One contemplated a voluntary contribution by the patentees; and the
other, the ransoming the freedoms of those who were willing to partake
of present profits arising by the trade or fishing on the coast. The
patentees, in the one case, agreed to pay one hundred pounds apiece
(the records say £110); in the other, inducements were offered to the
western cities and towns to form joint-stock associations for trade and fishing,
from which a revenue in the shape of royalty might be derived to the
Council: and, in order to further this latter project, letters were to be
issued to those cities, by the Privy Council, prohibiting any not free of that
business from visiting the coast, upon pain of confiscation of ship and
goods. This last scheme was not favorably received. The letters produced
an effect contrary to what was expected, since the restraining of the
liberty of free fishing gave alarm; and, as the Parliament of 1621 was
about to meet, every possible influence was brought to bear against this
great monopoly, with what effect we have already seen.</p>

<p>While the plan of voluntary associations failed, the business of exacting
a tax from individual fishermen was prosecuted with vigor, and probably;
in some instances with success. A proclamation against disorderly trading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
or visiting the coasts of New England without a license from the Council,
was issued. A grand scheme for settling the coast of New England by
a local government was marked out, and the <i>Platform of the Government</i>
was put into print.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The project of laying out a county on the Kennebec River; forty miles
square, for general purposes, and building a great city at the junction
of the Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers, was part of the great plan.
A ship and pinnace had been built at Whitby, a seaport in Yorkshire,
at large expense, for use in the colony; and others were contemplated.
They were to lie on the coast for the defence of the merchants and fishermen,
and to convoy the fleets as they went to and from their markets.
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who had been treasurer of the Council, was now
chosen governor, and was destined for New England; but the Company
were seriously embarrassed for funds, and finally were obliged to mortgage
the ship to some of their individual members. The assessments of £110
each were not all paid in, and patentees who did not intend to pay were
asked to resign, so that others might take their places. Constant complaints
were made of merchants who were violating the privileges of the
Company by sending out vessels for fishing and trading on the coast; and
orders were passed for applying remedies. The plan for the new patent
is constantly referred to in the records, and the present patentees are to be
warned that they will have no place in it, unless they pay up their past
dues. The inducement to be held out is, that all who actually pay £110
may have a place in the new grant, provided they “be persons of honor
or gentlemen of blood, except only six merchants to be admitted by us for
the service, and especial employments of the said Council in the course
of trade and commerce,” etc. But their schemes were not realized.</p>

<p>In the Council’s prospectus already cited, issued in the summer of 1622,
they say, “We have settled, at this present, several plantations along the
coast, and have granted patents to many more that are in preparation to be
gone with all conveniency.” The bare fact, however, is that the Pilgrims
at Plymouth were the only actual settlers, and they had landed within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
patent limits by the merest chance. There may have been some other
bodies of men, in small numbers, living on the coast, such as Gorges
used to hire, at large expense, to spend the winter there. His servant,
Richard Vines, a highly respectable man, was sent out to the coast for
trade and discovery, and spent some time in the country; and he is supposed
to have passed one winter during a great plague among the Indians,&mdash;perhaps
that of 1616-17,&mdash;at the mouth of the Saco River.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Vines
and John Oldham afterward had a patent of Biddeford, on that river.
Several scattering plantations were begun in the following year.</p>

<p>The complaints to the Council of abuses committed by fishermen and
other interlopers, who without license visited the coast, and by their conduct
caused the overthrow of the trade and the dishonor of the government,
led to the selection of Robert Gorges, the younger son of Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, and who was recently returned from the Venetian wars, to be sent
to New England for the correction of these abuses. He was commissioned
as lieutenant-general, and there were appointed for his council and assistants
Captain Francis West as admiral, Christopher Levett, and the governor
of Plymouth for the time being. Robert Gorges had but recently become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a shareholder in the grand patent, and he had also a personal grant of a
tract of land on the northeast side of Massachusetts Bay, ten miles along
the coast, and extending thirty miles into the interior. This was made to
him partly in consideration of his father’s services to the Company.</p>

<p>West was commissioned in November, 1622; and his arrival at Plymouth,
in New England, is noticed by Bradford “as about the latter end of June.”
He had probably been for some time on the Eastern coast as he related
his experiences to Bradford, who says he “had a commission to be admiral
of New England, to restrain interlopers and such fishing ships as came
to fish and trade without a license from the Council of New England, for
which they should pay a round sum of money. But he could do no good
of them, for they were too strong for him, and he found the fishermen
to be stubborn fellows.... So they went from hence to Virginia.” West
returned from Virginia in August, and probably joined Captain Gorges,
who made his appearance in the Bay of Massachusetts in August or September
of this year, having “sundry passengers and families, intending
there to begin a plantation, and pitched upon the place Mr. Weston’s
people had forsaken,” at Wessagusset. By his commission he and his
council had full power “to do and execute what to them should seem
good, in all cases, capital, criminal, and civil.”</p>

<p>This sending out of young Gorges with authority was probably a temporary
expedient for the present emergency, preparatory to the great scheme
of government set forth, a few months before he sailed, in the Council’s
<i>Briefe Relation</i>. Captain Gorges had a private enterprise to look after
while charged with these public duties. The patent which he brought
over, issued to himself personally, provided for a government to be
administered “acording to the great charter of England, and such Lawes
as shall be hereafter established by public authority of the State assembled
in Parliament in New England,” all decisions being subject to appeal to the
Council for New England, “and to the court of Parliament hereafter to
be in New England aforesaid.”</p>

<p>Gorges remained here but a short time,&mdash;probably not quite a year,&mdash;having
during his stay a sharp conflict with the notorious Thomas Weston,
whom Governor Bradford, in pity to the man, attempted to shield from
punishment. In speaking of Gorges’ return to England, Bradford says
that he “scarcely saluted the country in his government, not finding the
state of things here to answer his quality and condition.” His people
dispersed: some went to England, and some to Virginia. Sir Ferdinando
Gorges himself assigns another reason for his son’s speedy abandoning the
country. He says that Robert was sent out by Lord Gorges and himself,&mdash;meaning,
I suppose, that he came at their personal charge,&mdash;and that
he was disappointed in not receiving supplies from “divers his familiar
friends who had promised as much; but they, hearing how I sped
in the House of Parliament, withdrew themselves, and myself and friends
were wholly disabled to do anything to purpose.” The report of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
proceedings coming to his son’s ears, he was advised to return home till
better occasion should serve.</p>

<p>The records of the Council show that for the space of one year their
business was pursued with considerable vigor by the few members who
were interested.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Sir Ferdinando Gorges, of course, was the mainstay
of the enterprise. The principal business was to prepare to put their plans
into operation. The money did not come in, and a large number of the
patentees fell off. Much time was spent in inducing new members to
engage, and pay in their money; and the efforts to bring the merchant
fishermen to acknowledge the claims of the Council, and to take out
licenses for traffic and fishing, were untiring.</p>

<p>Finally, in the summer of 1623, the Council resolved to divide the whole
territory of New England among the patentees, “in the plot remaining with
Dr. Goche,” the treasurer. The reasons given for this step are, “For that
some of the adventurers excuse their non-payment in of their adventures
because they know not their shares for which they are to pay, which much
prejudiceth the proceedings, it is thought fit that the land of New England
be divided in this manner; viz., by 20 lots, and each lot to contain 2 shares.
And for that there are not full 40 and above 20 adventurers, that only
20 shall draw those lots.” Provision was accordingly made that each
person drawing two shares should part with one share to some member
who might not have drawn, or some one else who shall thereafter become
an adventurer, to the end that the full “number of forty may be complete.”
The meeting for the drawing was held on Sunday, June 29, 1623,
at Greenwich, at which the King was present.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The “plot” of New England, on which this division is shown, with
the names set down according as the lots were drawn, was published the
next year in Sir William Alexander’s <i>Encouragement to Colonies</i>; and on
page 31 of his book the writer speaks of hearing that “out of a generous
desire by his example to encourage others for the advancement of so brave
an enterprise he [Sir Ferdinando Gorges] is resolved shortly to go himself
in person, and to carry with him a great number well fitted for such
a purpose; and many noblemen in England (whose names and proportions
as they were marshalled by lot may appear upon the map), having interested
themselves in that bounds, are to send several colonies, who may quickly
make this to exceed all other plantations.”</p>

<p>Alexander must have been well informed of the intentions of the Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
certainly familiar with those of Gorges himself; and it must have
been with their knowledge and approbation that the act above recorded
was thus published.</p>

<p>The meeting at which the division was made is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
last of which we have any record for a number of years, and the history
of the Company during these years must be gathered from other sources.
The grand colonial scheme intended to be put in operation never went into
effect; and at a late period the Council say, concerning this division, that
hitherto they have never been confirmed in the lands so allotted.</p>

<p>A new Parliament was summoned to meet February 12, 1623/24, and
on the 24th we find this minute: “Mr. Neale delivereth in the bill for free
liberty of fishing upon the coasts of America.” “Five ships of Plymouth
under arrest, and two of Dartmouth, because they went to fish in New
England. This done by warrant from the Admiralty. To have these suits
staid till this bill have had its passage. This done by Sir Ferdinando
Gorges his Patent. Ordered, that this patent be brought into the Committee
of Grievances upon Friday next.” March 15, 1623/24, an Act for
freer liberty of fishing, as previously introduced, was committed to a large
committee, of which Sir Edward Coke was chairman. On the 17th, Sir
Edward reported from this committee that they had condemned one
grievance, namely, “Sir Ferdinand Gorges his patent for a plantation in New
England. Their council heard, the exceptions being first delivered them.
Resolved by consent, that, notwithstanding the clause in the patent dated
3d November, 18th Jac., that no subject of England shall visit the coast
upon pain of forfeiture of ship and goods, the patentees have yielded that
the Englishmen shall visit, and that they will not interrupt any fisherman
to fish there.” Finally it was enacted by the House that the clause of forfeiture,
being only by patent and not by act of Parliament, was void.</p>

<p>Gorges himself gives a graphic picture of the scene when he, with his
counsel, was before the Committee of the House, and he spoke so unavailingly
in defence of his patent. This patent was the first presented from
the Committee of Grievances. “This their public declaration of the
Houses ... shook off all my adventurers for plantation, and made many
of the patentees to quit their interest;” so that in all likelihood he would
have fallen under the weight of so heavy a burden, had he not been supported
by the King, who would not be drawn to overthrow the corporation
he so much approved of, and Gorges was advised to persevere. Still
he thought it better to forbear for the present, though the bill did not
become a law of the realm. Soon afterward the French ambassador made
a challenge of all those territories as belonging of right to the King of
France, and Gorges was called to make answer to him; and his reply was
so full that “no more was heard of that their claim.”</p>

<p>Being unable to enforce the claim whence was to come the principal
source of its income, and the larger part of the patentees having abandoned
the enterprise, the Great Council for New England, whose patent had been
denounced by the House of Commons as a monopoly and opposed to the
public policy and the general good, became a dead body. In the following
year, 1625, we hear of Gorges as commander of one of the vessels in
the squadron ordered by Buckingham to Dieppe for the service of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
King of France. Finding on his arrival that the vessels were destined
to serve against Rochelle, which was then sustaining a siege, Gorges broke
through the squadron, and returned to England with his ship.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1625 the Plymouth people were in great trouble by
reason of their unhappy relations to the Adventurers in London, and Captain
Standish was sent over to seek some accommodation with them. At
the same time he bore a letter from Governor Bradford to the Council of
New England, urging their intervention in behalf of the colony “under
your government.” But Bradford says that, by reason of the plague which
that year raged in London, Standish could do nothing with the Council
for New England, for there were no courts kept or scarce any commerce
held.</p>

<p>Two years later, in the summer of 1627, Governor Bradford again wrote
to the Council for New England, under whose government he acknowledged
themselves to be, and also to Sir Ferdinando Gorges himself, advising
them of the encroachments of the Dutch, and also making complaints
of the disorderly fishermen and interlopers, who, with no intent to plant,
and with no license, foraged the country and were off again, to the great
annoyance of the Plymouth settlers.</p>

<p>After a patent to Christopher Levett, of May 5, 1623, the Council appear
to have made no grants of land till, in 1628, two patents were issued,&mdash;one
to the Plymouth people of land on the Kennebec River, and one to Rosewell,
Young, Endicott, and others, patentees of Massachusetts. These were
followed by a grant to John Mason, of Nov. 7, 1629, the Laconia grant of
Nov. 17, 1629, that to Plymouth Colony of Jan. 13, 1629/30, and sundry
grants of territory in the present States of Maine and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>The records of the Council, of which there is a hiatus of over eight
years in the parts now extant (and the latter portion is a transcript with
probably many omissions), begin on the 4th of November, 1631, with the
Earl of Warwick as president, and contain entries of sundry patents
granted, and of the final transactions of the Company during its existence.
Precisely when the Earl of Warwick was chosen president we do
not know. His name appears in the Plymouth patent of Jan. 13, 1629/30,
as holding that office, and it is quite likely that he was president when
the Massachusetts patent was issued, he being chiefly instrumental in passing
that grant. The Council seem now to have revived their hopes as they
did their activity. As late as Nov. 6, 1634, divers matters of moment were
propounded: “First, that the number of the Council be with all convenient
speed filled. [It appears by a previous meeting that there were now
but twenty-one members in all, whereas the patent called for no less than
forty.] Second, that a new patent from his Majesty be obtained.” Also,
that no ships, passengers, nor goods be permitted to go to New England
without license from the President and Council; and that fishermen should
not be allowed to trade with savages, nor with the servants of planters,
nor to cut timber for stages, without license. This, surely, is a revival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the old odious policy. We do not know if any of these orders were
adopted.</p>

<p>There seems at this time to have arisen a serious misunderstanding or
quarrel between the Council and their President, the Earl of Warwick. It
first appears at a meeting held June 29, 1632. The President was not
present at this meeting, though it was held, as the meetings had been held
for some years past, at “Warwick House.” An order was adopted “that
the Earl of Warwick should be entreated to direct a course for finding out
what patents have been granted for New England.” At the same meeting
the clerk was sent to the Earl for the Council’s great seal, which was in his
lordship’s keeping; and word came back that he would send it when his
man came in. It was also ordered that the future meetings of the Council
be held at the house of Captain Mason, in Fenchurch Street. But the seal
was not sent, and two more formal requests were made for it during the
next six months. Captain John Mason was chosen vice-president Nov.
26, 1632. The records for 1633 and 1634 are wanting. Early in 1635
the Council resolved to resign their patent into the hands of the King;
preparatory to which they made a new partition of the territory of New
England, dividing it among themselves, or, according to the records,
among eight of their number. Of what precise number the Council consisted
at this time we have no means of knowing. The division was
made at a meeting held Feb. 3, 1634/35, and to the description of each
particular grant the members on the 14th of April affixed their signatures,
each person withholding his signature to his own share. In making this
division it was ordered that every one who had lawful grants of land, or
lawfully settled plantations, should enjoy the same, laying down his <i>jura
regalia</i> to the proprietor of this division, and paying him some small acknowledgment.
A memorandum is also made that “the 22d day of April
several deeds of feoffment were made unto the several proprietors.”</p>

<p>The act of surrender passed June 7, 1635. Lord Gorges had been
chosen president April 18. The Company seem to have been kept alive
till some years later, as there is an entry as late as Nov. 1, 1638, at which
it was agreed to augment the grants of the Earl of Sterling and Lord
Gorges and Sir F. Gorges, the two latter to have “sixty miles more added
to their proportions further up into the main land.” Of course, in making
this division the whole patent of Nov. 3, 1620, was not divided, for that
ran from sea to sea. It was a division on the New England coast, running
back generally sixty miles inland. It was part of the plan to procure from
the King, under the great seal of England, a confirmation of these several
grants. Lord Sterling’s grant included also Long Island, near Hudson’s
River.</p>

<p>The intention in this division was to ride over the Massachusetts patent
of 1628, which had been confirmed the following year by a charter of
incorporation from the King, and legal proceedings were soon afterward
instituted by a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> for vacating their franchises. The
notorious Thomas Morton was retained as a solicitor to prosecute this suit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The grants issued in this division to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and to John
Mason are the only ones with which subsequent history largely deals.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>The King, in accepting the resignation of the Grand Patent, resolved to
take the management of the affairs of New England into his own hands,
and to appoint as his general governor Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who himself,
or by deputy, was to reside in the country. But “the best laid
schemes o’ mice and men gang aft a-gley.” The attempt to vacate the
charter of Massachusetts Bay, a fundamental thing to be done, was not accomplished.
The patentees to whom several of the divisions of the territory
of New England were assigned appear to have wholly neglected their
interest, and, except in the case of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, before referred
to, royal charters were granted to none.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut were settled
under grants, or alleged grants, from the Council for New England. The
grant of the territory of Massachusetts Bay of March 19, 1627/28, was
in the following year confirmed by the Crown, with powers of government.
The grant to Sir Ferdinando Gorges in the general division of
February, 1634/35, with an additional sixty miles into the interior subsequently
added, was confirmed by the Crown April 3, 1639, with a charter
constituting him Lord Proprietor of the Province of Maine, and giving him
extraordinary powers of government. The territory issued to John Mason
at the general division, which was to be called New Hampshire, the parchment
bearing date April 22, 1635, was never confirmed by the King, nor
were any powers of government granted. The first settlements in Connecticut,&mdash;namely,
those of the three towns on the river of that name, in 1635
and 1636,&mdash;were made under the protection of Massachusetts, as though
the territory had been part of that colony. But the inhabitants subsequently
acquired a <i>quasi</i> claim to this territory, under what is known as
the “old patent of Connecticut,” impliedly proceeding from the Council
for New England, through the Earl of Warwick, to Lord Say and Sele
and his associates. The settlers of Quinnipiack, afterward called New
Haven, in 1638 and 1639, had no patent for lands, but made a number of
purchases from the Indians. Plymouth Colony, of which an account is
given here by another hand, received a roving patent from the Council,
dated June 1, 1621, with no boundaries; and another patent, dated Jan.
13, 1629/30, defining their limits, but with no powers of government.
The territory of Rhode Island was not a grant from the Council to the
settlers.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Massachusetts.</span>&mdash;There were scattered settlements in Massachusetts
Bay prior to the emigration under the patent of 1627/28. Thomas Weston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
began a settlement at what is now Weymouth Fore-River, in the summer
of 1622, which lasted scarcely one year. Robert Gorges, as we have seen,
took possession of the same place, in September, 1623, for his experimental
government, but the colony broke up the next spring, leaving, it is thought,
a few remnants behind, which proved a seed for
a continuous settlement. Persons are found temporarily
at Nantasket in 1625, and perhaps earlier;
at Mount Wollaston the same year, and at
Thompson’s Island in 1626. The solitary William
Blaxton, clerk, is traced to Shawmut,
(Boston) in 1625 or 1626, and the equally
solitary Samuel Maverick, at Noddles’
Island, about the same time;
while Walford, the blacksmith,
is found at Charlestown in 1629.
The last three named are reasonably
conjectured to have formed part of Robert Gorges’ company at
Weymouth, in 1623/24.</p>

<p>The Dorchester Fishing Company, in England, of which the Rev. John
White, a zealous Puritan minister of that town, was a member, resolved to
make the experiment of planting a small colony somewhere upon the coast,
so that the fishing vessels might leave behind in the country all the spare
men not required to navigate their vessels home, who might in the mean
time employ themselves in planting, building, etc., and be ready to join the
ships again on their return to the coast at the next fishing season. Cape
Ann was selected as the site of this experiment, and in the autumn of 1623
fourteen men were left there to pass the winter. In the latter part of the
year 1625 Roger Conant, who had been living at Plymouth and at Nantasket,
was invited to join this community as its superintendent, and he
remained there one year. The scheme proving a financial failure, the settlement
broke up in the autumn of 1626, most of the men returning home;
but Conant and a few others removed to Naumkeag (Salem), where they
were found by Endicott, who, under the authority of the Massachusetts
patentees, arrived there Sept. 6, 1628. These old settlers joined the new
community.</p>

<p>Endicott was sent out as agent or superintendent of a large land company,
of which he was one of the proprietors, colonization being, of course,
a prominent feature in their plans. In the following year, March 4, 1628-29,
the patentees and their associates received a charter of incorporation,
with powers of government, and with authority to establish a subordinate
government on the soil, and appoint officers of the same. This local government,
entitled “London’s Plantation in Massachusetts Bay in New
England,” was accordingly established, and Endicott was appointed the
first resident governor. The charter evidently contemplated that the government
of the Company should be administered in England. In a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
months, however, the Company resolved to transfer the charter and government
from London to Massachusetts Bay; and Matthew Cradock, who
had been the first charter governor, resigned
his place, and John Winthrop, who
had resolved to emigrate to the colony,
was chosen governor of the Company in
his stead. On the transfer of the Company to Massachusetts by the arrival
of Winthrop, the subordinate government, of which Endicott was the
head, was silently abolished, and its duties were assumed by its principal,
the corporation itself, which took immediate direction of affairs. As the
successor of Cradock, Winthrop was the second governor of the Massachusetts
Company, yet he was the first who exercised his functions in New
England.</p>

</div>

<p>The Massachusetts charter was not adapted for the constitution of a
commonwealth; therefore, as the colony grew in numbers it became necessary
for it to assume powers not granted in that instrument. Between the
years 1630 and 1640 about twenty thousand persons arrived in the colony,
after which, for many years, it is supposed that more went back to England
than came thence hither. Previous to the year last named the colony
had furnished emigrants to settle the colonies of Connecticut, New Haven,
and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The charter gave power to the freemen to elect annually a governor, deputy-governor,
and eighteen assistants, who should make laws for their own
benefit and for the government of the colony; and provision was made for
general courts and courts of assistants, which exercised judicial as well as
legislative powers. But at the first meeting of the general court in Boston, in
October, 1630, it was ordered that the governor and deputy-governor should
be chosen by the assistants out of their own number. This rule was of
short duration, as in May, 1632, the freemen resumed the right of election,
and the basis of a second house of legislature was laid.</p>

<p>The colonists, though Puritans, were Church of England men, and were
fearful of rigid separation; but Winthrop and his party,&mdash;among whom
was John Wilson, a graduate of King’s College, Cambridge, and destined
to become their first minister,&mdash;found on their arrival a church already
established at Salem on the basis of separation. Thenceforward, following
that example, the Massachusetts colony became a colony of congregational
churches. It has been a favorite saying with eulogists of
Massachusetts, that the pious founders of the colony came over to this
wilderness to establish here the principle of civil and religious liberty, and
to transmit the same inviolate to their remotest posterity. Probably nothing
was further from their purpose, which was simply to find a place where
they themselves, and all who agreed with them, could enjoy such liberty.
This was a desirable object to attain, and they made many sacrifices for it,
and felt that they had a right to enjoy it.</p>

<p>The banishment of Roger Williams, and of Mrs. Hutchinson and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
sympathizers, was no doubt largely due to the feeling that the peace of the
community was endangered by their presence. In the unhappy episode of
the Quakers, at a later period, the colonial authorities were wrought into a
frenzy by these “persistent intruders.” It seemed to be a struggle on both
sides for victory; but though four Quakers were hanged on Boston Common,
the Quakers finally conquered. In the second year of the settlement,
in order to keep the government in their own hands, or, in the
language of the Act,
“to the end the body
of the commons may
be preserved of honest
and good men,” the
Court ordered that
thenceforward no one
should be elected a
freeman unless he was
a member of one of the
churches of the colony.
Probably there were as
good men outside the
churches as there were
inside, and by and by
a clamor was raised by
those who felt aggrieved
at being denied the
rights of freemen; but
the rule was not modified
till after the Restoration.</p>

<p>A few unsavory persons
whom Winthrop
and his company found
here and speedily sent
away, on their arrival home failed not to make representations injurious
to the Puritan settlement, and they were seconded by the influence of Sir
Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason. Attempts were made in 1632 to vacate
the colony’s charter; but these attempts proved unsuccessful. A more
serious effort was made a few years later, when the Council for New England
resigned its franchises into the hands of the King; but owing to the trouble
which environed the government in England, and to other causes not fully
explained, the colony then escaped, as it also escaped at the same time the
impending infliction of a general governor for New England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1640 some of the colony’s friends in England wrote to the authorities
here advising them to send some one to England to solicit favors of
the Parliament. “But, consulting about it,” says Winthrop, “we declined
the motion, for this consideration,&mdash;that if we should put ourselves under
the protection of Parliament, we must then be
subject to all such laws as they should make,
or at least such as they might impose upon
us; in which course, though they should intend
our good, yet it might prove very prejudicial
to us.” From 1640 to 1660 the colony
was substantially an independent commonwealth,
and during this period they completed
a system of laws and government
which, taken as a whole, was well adapted to
their wants. Their “Body of Liberties” was
established in 1641, and three editions of
Laws were published by authority, and put
in print in 1649, in 1660, and in 1672. The
first law establishing public schools was
passed in October, 1647. Harvard College
had already, in 1637, been established at
Cambridge.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical polity of the churches,
embodied in the “Cambridge Platform,” was
drawn up in 1648, and printed in the following
year, and was finally approved by the
General Court in 1651.</p>

<p>The community was obliged to feel its way, and adapt its legislation
rather to its exigencies than to its charter. The aristocratical element in
the society early cropped out in the institution of a Council for life, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
may have had its origin in suggestions from England; but it met with
little favor.</p>

<p>The confederation of the United Colonies, first proposed by Connecticut,
was an act of great wisdom, foreshadowing the more celebrated political
unions of the English
race on this continent, for
they all have recognized
the common maxim, that
“Union is strength.” The
colonists were surrounded
by “people of several
nations and strange language,”
and the existence
of the Indian tribes within
the boundaries of the
New England settlements
was the source of ceaseless
anxiety and alarm.
The Pequot War had but
recently ended, and it had
left its warning. It would
have been an act of grace
to admit the Maine and
Narragansett settlements
to this union, but it was
probably impracticable.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250">DR. JOHN CLARK.</p>
           <p class="pf250">[This portrait of a leading physician of the
colony hangs in the gallery of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and is inscribed “Ætatis suæ
66 ann. suo,” and purports to be a Dr. John
Clark, and is probably the physician of that
name of Newbury and Boston, who died in 1664.
His son John, likewise a physician, was also a
prominent public man in Boston, and died in
1690. That it is the former is believed by Dr.
Thacher in his <i>American Medical Biography</i>,
and by Coffin in his <i>History of Newbury</i>, both
of whom give lithographs of the picture. Dr.
Appleton, who printed an account of the Society’s
portrait in its <i>Proceedings</i>, September,
1867, also took this view; while the Rev. Dr.
Harris, in the Society’s <i>Collections</i>, third series,
vii. 287, finds the year 1675 in the inscription,
which is not there, and identifies the subject of
the picture with another Dr. John Clark, who
was prominent in Rhode Island history. There
was still a third Dr. John Clark, son of John,
and of Boston, who died in 1728. It is not probably
determinable beyond doubt which of the
earlier two this is; and Savage, in his <i>Genealogical
Dictionary</i>, gives twenty-five John Clarks
as belonging to New England before the end
of the first century; but of these only four are
physicians, as above named. Cf. <i>Massachusetts
Historical Society’s Proceedings</i>, July, 1844, p. 287.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>The conversion of the
Indian tribes to Christianity
was a subject which
the colony had much at
heart, and a number of its ministers had fitted themselves for the work: the
special labors of the Apostle Eliot need only be mentioned. Through the
instrumentality of Edward Winslow, a society for propagating the gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
among the Indians was incorporated in England in 1649, and the Commissioners
of the United Colonies were made the agents of its corporation as
long as the union of the colonies lasted.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts colonists were at first seriously tasked for the means
of subsistence; but these anxieties soon passed away. Industry took the
most natural forms. Agriculture gave back good returns. To the invaluable
Indian maize were added all kinds of English grain, as well as vegetables
and fruits. Some were indigenous to the soil. English seeds of
hay and of grain returned bountiful crops. All animals with which New
England farms are now stocked then well repaid in increase the care bestowed
upon them. The manufacture of clothing was of slower growth.
Thread and yarn were spun and knit by the women at home; but in a few
years weaving and fulling mills were set up, and became remunerative.
The manufacture of salt, saltpetre, gunpowder, and glassware gave employment
to many, while the brickmaker, the mason, the carpenter, and indeed
all kindred trades found occupation. The forests were a source of income.
Boards, clapboards, shingles, staves, and, at a later period, masts had a
ready sale. Furs and peltry, received in barter from the Indians, became
features of an export trade. The fisheries should be specially enumerated
as a source of wealth, and this industry led to the building of ships, which
were the medium of commerce with the neighboring colonies, the West
Indies, and even with Spain.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>After the coin brought over by the settlers had gone back to England
to pay for supplies, the colony was greatly embarrassed for a circulating medium,
and Indian corn and beaver-skins were early used as currency, while
wampum was employed in trade with the Indians. The colony, however,
in 1652 established a mint, where was coined, from the Spanish silver which
had been introduced from the West Indies, and from whatever bullion and
plate might be sent in from any quarter, the New England money so well
known in our histories of American coinage.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The relation of the colony
to the surrounding New England plantations is noticed further on in the
brief accounts given of those settlements.</p>

<p>Events in England moved rapidly onward. The execution of King
Charles occurred about two months before the death of Winthrop, which
happened on the 26th of March, 1648/49, and it is certain that the latter
never heard of the tragic end of his old master. The colonists prudently
acknowledged their subjection to the Parliament, and afterward to Cromwell,
so far as was necessary to keep upon terms with both. Hutchinson
says that he had nowhere met with any marks of disrespect to the memory
of the late king, and that there was no room to suppose they bore any disaffection
to his son; and if they feared his restoration, it was because they
expected a change in religion, and that a persecution of all Nonconformists
would follow. Charles II. was tardily proclaimed in the colony, owing, perhaps,
to a lack of definite information as to the state of politics in England,
and to rumors that the people there were in an unsettled condition.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A loyal
address was finally agreed upon and sent; but he was not proclaimed till
August of the following year, 1661. The Restoration brought trouble to
the colony. Among those who laid their grievances before the King in
Council were Mason and Gorges, each a grandson and heir of a more distinguished
proprietor of lands in New England. They alleged that the
colony had, in violation of the rights of the petitioners, extended its jurisdiction
over the provinces of New Hampshire and Maine. The Quakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and some of the Eastern people also had their complaints to make against
the colony.</p>

<p>To the humble address made to the King a benignant answer was received;
but an order soon afterward came that persons be sent over authorized to
make answer for the colony to all complaints alleged against it. These agents
on their return brought a letter from the King to the colony, in which he
promised to preserve its patent and privileges; but he also required of
the colony that its laws should be reviewed, and such as were against the
King’s authority repealed; that the oath of allegiance and the forms of justice
be administered in the King’s name; that no one who desired to use
the book of Common Prayer should be prejudiced thereby as to the baptism
of his children or admission to the sacrament or to civil privilege.</p>

<p>These requirements were grievous to the people of Massachusetts; but
worse was to come. In the spring of 1664 intelligence was brought that
several men-of-war were coming from England with some gentlemen of
distinction on board, and preparations were made to receive them. At
the next meeting of the General Court a day of fasting and prayer was
appointed, and their patent and its duplicate were brought into Court and
committed to the charge of four trusty men for safe-keeping. The ships
arrived in July, with four commissioners having authority for reducing the
Dutch at Manhados, and for visiting the several New England colonies, and
hearing and determining all matters of complaint, and settling the peace
and security of the country. Proceeding on their errand to the Manhados,
the Dutch surrendered on articles.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> In the mean time an address was
agreed upon by the Court to be sent to the King, in which was recounted
the sacrifices and early struggles of the colonists, while they prayed for the
preservation of their liberties. Colonel Nichols remaining in New York,
the other commissioners returned to New England, and, having despatched
their business elswhere, came to Boston in May, 1665, after they had been
joined by Colonel Nichols. Governor Endicott had died the preceding
March, and Mr. Bellingham, the deputy-governor, stood in his place. The
commissioners laid their claim before the Court, and demanded an answer.
There was skirmishing on both sides. It is a long story, filling many pages
of the colony records. The envoys asked to have their commission acknowledged
by the government; but this would have overridden the charter
of the colony, and placed the inhabitants at the mercy of their enemies.
In short, the authorities refused to yield, and the commissioners, after being
defeated in other attempts to effect their purpose, were called home. Several
letters and addresses followed. Thus ended for a time the contest with
the Crown. For nearly ten years there was an almost entire suspension of
political relations between New England and the mother country. But the
projects of the Home Government were not given over. Gorges and Mason
persisted in their claims. In the mean time New England was ravaged by an
Indian war, known as Philip’s War. The distress was great, and the loss of
life fearful. During its progress Edward Randolph, the evil genius of New
England, appeared on the scene, prepared for mischief.</p>

make answer. This was but the beginning of the end. The legal authorities
in England, before whom the case was brought, decided that neither Maine
nor New Hampshire was within the chartered limits of Massachusetts, and
that the title of the former was in the grandson of the original proprietor.
Whereupon the agent of Massachusetts bought the patent of Maine from
its proprietor for £1,250, and stood in his shoes as lord paramount.</p>

<p>This greatly displeased the King, and the hostility to the colony continued.
Additional charges, such as illegal coining of money, violations of the laws
of trade and navigation, and legislative provisions repugnant to the laws of
England and contrary to the power of the charter, were now alleged against
the colony. The agents of the colony and the emissaries of the Crown
crossed and recrossed the ocean with apologies on the one hand and requisitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
on the other; but nothing would satisfy the Crown but the subjugation
of the colony. A <i>quo warranto</i> against the Governor and Company
was issued in 1683; and finally, by a new suit of <i>scire facias</i> brought in the
Court of Chancery, judgment against the Company was entered up Oct.
23, 1684. Intelligence of this was not officially received till the following
summer. Meantime the new king, James II., was proclaimed, April 20,
1685. The government of the colony was expiring. The “Rose” frigate
arrived in Boston May 14, 1686, bringing a commission for Joseph Dudley
as President of the Council for Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, and
Maine, and the Narraganset country, or King’s Province. There was no
House of Deputies to oppose him. Dudley was succeeded by Sir Edmund
Andros on the 19th of December, who had arrived in the frigate “Kingfisher,”
with a commission for the government of New England. He was
detested by the colony, and the people only needed a rumor of the revolution
in England, which reached Boston in the spring of 1689, to provoke
a rising, and he was thrown into prison.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> A provisional government, with

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Maine.</span>&mdash;There were many settlements on the coast of Maine prior
to the grant to Gorges from the Council in 1635, and consequently before
his subsequent charter from the King. Indeed, very little was done by
Gorges as Lord Proprietor of Maine. The patents from the Council to
the year 1633 had embraced the whole territory from Piscataqua to Penobscot,
thus including the territory on both sides the Kennebec, which was
claimed by the Pilgrims of Plymouth under their patent of Jan. 13, 1629/30.
In various places settlements had already been begun. In the royal charter
to Gorges, whose grant extended from Piscataqua to Sagadahoc, the rights
of previous grantees were reserved to them, they relinquishing or laying
down their <i>jura regalia</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest permanent settlement in this State, on the mainland, would
seem to have been made at Pemaquid. One John Brown, of New Harbor,
bought land in that quarter
of the Indians as early as
July 15, 1625, the acknowledgment
of the deed being
taken by Abraham Shurt, of
Pemaquid, in the same month in the following year, if there
is no error in Shurt’s deposition. Shurt says that he came over as the
agent of the subsequent proprietors, Aldsworth and Elbridge, who had a
grant of Pemaquid from the Council, issued Feb. 29, 1631/32, and that he
bought for them the Island of Monhegan, on which a fishing settlement,
temporarily broken up in 1626, was made three years before.</p>

<p>The settlement at the mouth of the Saco River must have begun soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
after Richard Vines took possession of his grant there in 1630. During the
same year Cleeves and Tucker settled near the mouth of the Spurwink;
but in two years they removed to the neck of land on which Portland now
stands, and laid the foundation of that city. In applications to the Council
for grants of land made respectively to Walter Bagnall and John Stratton,
Dec. 2, 1631, the former represents himself to have lived in New England
“for the space of seven years,” and the latter “three years last past.”
Bagnall’s patent included Richmond Island, where he had lived some three
years at least. He was killed by the Indians two months before the Council
acted upon his application. Stratton’s grant was located at Cape Porpoise.
Bagnall probably had been one of Thomas Morton’s unruly crew at Mt.
Wollaston, in Boston Harbor.</p>

<p>In 1630 what is known as the “Plough Patent” was issued by the Council.
The original parchment is lost, and it is nowhere recorded. The grant
was bounded on the east by Cape Elizabeth, and on the west by Cape Porpoise,
a distance of some thirty miles on the sea-coast. This included the
patents on the Saco River previously granted, against which Vines protested.
There was early a dispute as to its extent. The holders of it came over in
the ship “Plough,” in 1631. They went to the eastward; but not liking the
place, came to Boston. They subsequently fell out among themselves, and,
as Winthrop says, “vanished away.” Afterward the patent fell into the
hands of others, and played an important part for a number of years in the
history of Maine, of which notice will be taken further on.</p>

<p>On Dec. 2, 1631, a grant of land of twenty-four thousand acres in extent
was made to a number of persons, including Ferdinando Gorges, a
grandson of Sir Ferdinando, then some three years of age. This territory
was on both sides of the Acomenticus River. Some settlements were made
here about this time, and April 10, 1641, after the Gorges government was
established, the borough of Acomenticus was incorporated, and in the following
March the place was chartered as the city of “Gorgeana.”</p>

<p>There were other early settlements on the coast of Maine, but we have no
space for their enumeration. The inhabitants, really or nominally, for the
most part sympathized with the Loyalist party as well in politics as in religion,
and it was the policy of the proprietor of Maine to foster no opposing
views. They were subjected to no external government until the arrival of
Captain William Gorges, in 1636, as deputy-governor, with commissions to
Richard Vines and others as councillors of the province, to which the
name of “New Somersetshire” was given. The first meeting of the commissioners
was held at Saco, March 25, 1636, where the first provincial
jurisdiction in this section of New England was exercised. The records of
this province do not extend beyond 1637, and it is uncertain whether the
courts continued to be held until the new organization of the government
of Maine in 1640. In 1636 George Cleeves, a disaffected person who lived
at Casco, went to England, and next year returned with a commission
from Sir Ferdinando Gorges, authorizing several persons in Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Bay to govern his province of New Somersetshire, and to oversee his servants,
etc. The authorities of the Bay declined the service, and the matter
“passed in silence.” Winthrop says they did not see what authority Gorges
had to grant such commissions.</p>

<p>The charter of Maine, which covered the same territory as New Somersetshire,
having been granted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, he issued a commission
for its government. This included a number of his kinsmen, with
Thomas Gorges as deputy-governor. The first General Court under this
government was held at Saco, June 25, 1640, under an earlier commission
and before the arrival of the deputy-governor. This Court exercised the
powers of an executive and legislative, as well as of a judicial, body, in the
name of “Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Knight, Lord Proprietor of the Province
of Maine.” The second term of the Court was held in September, when
the Deputy-Governor was present. He made his headquarters at Gorgeana.
The records of the courts between 1641 and 1644, inclusive, are
not preserved. Deputy-Governor Gorges sailed for England in 1643, leaving
Richard Vines at the head of the government. At a meeting held at
Saco in 1645, the Court, not having heard from the proprietor, appointed
Richard Vines deputy-governor for one year, and if he departed within the
year, Henry Josselyn was to take his place. The civil war was raging in
England at this time, and Sir Ferdinando Gorges was active for the King,
and was in Prince Rupert’s army at the siege of Bristol. When that city
was retaken by the Parliamentary forces, in 1645, he was plundered and
imprisoned. Under these circumstances he had no time to give to his distant
province. In 1645 the Court ordered that Richard Vines shall have
power to take possession of all goods and chattels of Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, and to pay such debts as Gorges may owe.</p>

<p>But Gorges’ authority was not, meanwhile, without its rival. Not long
after the government under the charter of 1639 had been organized, George
Cleeves, of Casco, again went to England, and induced Alexander Rigby,
“a lawyer and Parliament-man,” from Wigan, Lancashire, to purchase the
abandoned Plough patent before mentioned, which he did, April 7, 1643;
and Cleeves received a commission from him, as deputy, to administer its
affairs. By the following January he had returned, and, landing at Boston,
he solicited the aid of the Massachusetts Government against the authority
of Gorges; but that Government declined to interfere. Cleeves claimed
that Casco was within the bounds of his patent, and he immediately set up
his authority as “Deputy-President of the Province of Lygonia,” extending
his jurisdiction over a large part of the Province of Maine, which was then
under the administration of Richard Vines, as deputy for Gorges. This
produced a collision, and both parties appealed to Massachusetts, which
declined, as before, to act; but finally, in 1646, after Vines had left the
country, the Bay Government consented to serve as umpire; but no conclusion
was reached. Winthrop says that both parties failed of proof; and
as a joint appeal had been made to the Commissioners for Foreign Plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
in England, they were advised in the mean time to live peaceably
together. Rigby’s position and influence in Parliament secured a decision
in his favor, while Gorges at that time was in no position to protect his
interests. The decision of the Commissioners, which was given in 1646, terminated
Gorges’ jurisdiction over that part of Maine included in the Province
of Lygonia, embracing the settlements from Casco to Cape Porpoise,
and including both. The last General Court under the authority of Gorges,
of which any record exists, was held at Wells, in July of this year.</p>

<p>At length, in 1649, the inhabitants of the western part of this province,
between Cape Porpoise and Piscataqua River,&mdash;including Wells, Gorgeana,
and Piscataqua,&mdash;having had intelligence in 1647 of the death of the proprietor
(Gorges died in May of that year, and was buried on the fourteenth
of the month), and finding no one in authority there, and having in vain
written to his heirs to ascertain their wishes, formed a combination among
themselves. Mr. Edward Godfrey was chosen governor, the style of the
“Province of Maine” being still retained. This state of things continued
till 1652/53, when the towns were annexed to Massachusetts. The inhabitants
then living between Casco and the Kennebec were few in number.
Thomas Purchase, one of the proprietors of the Pejepscot patent, had, in
1639, conveyed a large tract to Massachusetts with alleged powers of government
over it. The people living within the Kennebec patent were
regarded as belonging to the jurisdiction of New Plymouth.</p>

<p>In the mean time the inhabitants under the Lygonia government quietly
submitted to its authority. Alexander Rigby died in August, 1650, and
the proprietorship of Lygonia fell to his son Edward. In brief, the government
was soon at an end. The inhabitants of Cape Porpoise and Saco
submitted to Massachusetts in 1652, and the remaining settlements in 1658.
Thus was accomplished what the Bay Colony had for some time been aiming
to effect,&mdash;the bringing of these eastern settlements under her jurisdiction.
Having decided that the northern boundary of her patent extended
three miles above the northernmost head of the Merrimac River, the commissioners
appointed on a recent survey showed that the northern line, as
run by them, terminated at Clapboard Island (about three miles eastward of
Casco peninsula); and this brought the Maine settlements within the bounds
of the Massachusetts charter. This state of things continued till after the
restoration of Charles II., when the hopes of those favorable to the Gorges
interest began to revive. Young Ferdinando Gorges, the grandson and heir
of the old proprietor, petitioned the Crown to be restored to his inheritance.
His agent, Mr. Archdale, came into the province, and appointed magistrates
to act under his authority, but the Government of Massachusetts speedily
repressed all such movements. Charles II., however, soon directed his attention
to New England. He appointed four commissioners to proceed thither,
charged with important duties and clothed with large powers. They, or
three of them, visited the province in the summer of 1665, and at York
issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of Maine, requiring them to submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
to the immediate protection and government of the King; and in his
Majesty’s name forbidding the magistrates either of Massachusetts or of the
claimant to exercise jurisdiction there, until his Majesty’s pleasure should
be further known. A provisional government was therefore established,
and the revival of the Church of England was encouraged.</p>

<p>In the previous year the Duke of York received a charter of the Province
of New York, and, embraced within the same document, was a grant of the
territories between the St. Croix and Pemaquid, which was interpreted to
include Pemaquid and its dependencies; and a government was subsequently
erected there under the name of Cornwall County. After the
Duke became King it was a royal province. This was beyond the eastern
bounds of the Province of Maine. There had scarcely been even a pretence
of a civil government here under the old patents. The Royal Commissioners
speak of the low moral condition of the people of this region.
“For the most part,” they say, “they are fishermen, and share in their
wives as they do in their boats.” The government under the Duke of
York was of an uncertain character, and was subject to the contingencies
of political changes; and in 1674 the Government of Massachusetts, on
the petition of the inhabitants, took them for a time under its protection.
During the Indian wars which scourged the eastern settlements, in the latter
part of that century, the Pemaquid country was wholly depopulated.</p>

</div>

<p>The Government established by the Royal Commissioners in the
Province of Maine never possessed any permanent principle or power
to give sanction to its authority, and in 1668 it had nearly died out; at
this time the inhabitants there looked to the wise and stable Government
of Massachusetts for relief, and so petitioned to be again taken under its
jurisdiction. Four commissioners, therefore, accompanied by a military
escort were sent from the Bay, and reaching York in July, 1668, assumed
jurisdiction “by virtue of their charter.” There were a few prominent individuals
who did not quietly submit, but they were summarily dealt with.
Renewed exertions were now made by the proprietor and his friends for a
recognition of his title, and at length they so far prevailed as to obtain letters
from the King, dated March 10, 1675/76, requiring the Massachusetts
Colony to send over agents with full instructions to answer all complaints.
The agents appeared within the time specified, and after a full hearing the
authorities decided that neither Maine nor New Hampshire was within the
chartered limits of Massachusetts, and that the government of Maine belonged
to the heir of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Soon after this decision an
agent of Massachusetts made a proposition for the purchase of the province,
which was accepted; and in March, 1677/78, Ferdinando Gorges transferred
his title for £1,250, and Massachusetts became lord-paramount of Maine.
This proceeding was a surprise to the inhabitants of the province, and, as
might have been expected, gave offence to the King, who ineffectually demanded
that the bargain should be cancelled. Massachusetts, as the lawful
assign of Ferdinando Gorges, now took possession of the province. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
proclamation to that effect was issued March 17, 1679/80; and a government
was set up at York, of which Thomas Danforth was deputed to be
president for one year. This
state of things continued till
the accession of James II.,
when the events in Maine were
shaped by the revolution which took place in Massachusetts, and Danforth
was in the end provisionally restored, as Bradstreet had been in the Bay.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">New Hampshire.</span>&mdash;The first settlement in New Hampshire was made
by David Thomson, a Scotchman, in the spring of 1623, at Little Harbor,
on the south side of the mouth of Piscataqua River. He had received a
patent from the Council of New England the year before, and came over in
the ship “Jonathan,” of Plymouth, under an indentured agreement with
three merchants of Plymouth in England. He lived at Little Harbor till
1626, when he removed to an island in Boston Harbor, which now bears his
name. By 1628 he had died, leaving a wife and child. There is reason to
believe that the settlement at Little Harbor was continued after Thomson
left the place.</p>

<p>Following Thomson,&mdash;perhaps about 1627,&mdash;came Edward Hilton,
a fishmonger of London, who settled six miles up the river, on a place
afterward called Hilton’s Point, or Dover Neck. Here he was joined by a
few others, including his brother William and his family, who had been at
New Plymouth. In 1630 Hilton and his associates received from the Council
a patent of the place on which he was settled. This was dated March 12,
1629 (O. S.), and the whole or part of it they soon sold to some merchants
of Bristol in England. Two years later the patent, or a large interest in
it, was purchased by Lord Say, Lord Brook, and other gentlemen friendly
to Massachusetts. This latter agreement was effected through the agency
of Thomas Wiggin, who had gone over to England in 1632, and who in
the following year returned, bringing with him a large accession to the
settlement, which included a “worthy Puritan divine,” who soon left for
want of adequate support. Other ministers came, and some laymen, all of
whom had been in bad repute in Massachusetts. Although the inhabitants
went through the form of electing magistrates, there was no authorized
government. The original proprietor of the patent had left the place, and
scenes of confusion, both civil and ecclesiastical, sometimes highly amusing,
characterized the settlement for a number of years. In 1637 the people
combined into a body politic, which seems not to have received general sanction,
and the notorious George Burdett supplanted Wiggin, the former
governor; but the troubles which subsequently ensued led to a new combination,
Oct. 22, 1640, signed by forty-two persons, or nearly every
resident. Massachusetts had for some years desired to bring the several
governments on the Piscataqua and its branches under her jurisdiction, and
had, by an early revision of the northern boundary of her patent, decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that it included them. The inhabitants here desired to be under a stable
government, and on June 14, 1641, they submitted to the Massachusetts
authorities, and the Act of Union was passed by that Government, Oct. 9
following.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>The next independent settlement was made by the Laconia Company in
1630. This company was formed soon after the Laconia patent of Nov. 17,
1629, was granted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason. It was an
unincorporated association of nine persons, most of whose names appear
in a subsequent grant of land, to be presently mentioned. Some of these
associates had been members of the Canada Company, of which Sir William
Alexander was the head, who had undertaken the conquest of Canada
as a private enterprise, under the command of Sir David Kirke. The
fur-trade of that province was the tempting prize. The sudden peace which
followed the conquest, with the stipulation that all articles captured should
be restored, brought the Canada Company to grief. Ten days after the return
of the expedition, Sir Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason took out the
patent above mentioned. The purpose of the Company was to engage in
the fur-trade; to send cargoes of Indian truck-goods to the Piscataqua and
unlade them at their factories near the mouth of the river, and thence to
transport them in boats or canoes up the river to Lake Champlain, to be bartered
there for peltries for the European market. Their patent was a grant
of a vaguely bounded territory on the lakes of the Iroquois, which they
named Laconia. The first vessel despatched to Piscataqua was the barque
“Warwick,” which sailed from London the last of March, 1630, and which
by the first of June had arrived, with Walter Neal, governor, and Ambrose
Gibbons, factor, and some others. They took possession of the house and
land at Odiorne’s Point, Little Harbor, which Thomson had left in 1626,&mdash;perhaps
by an agreement with his associates. In the following year others
were sent. Stations for the Company’s operations were also established at
Strawberry Bank (Portsmouth), and at Newichwaneck (South Berwick),
on the eastern side of the river. Captain Neal was charged with the duty
of penetrating into the interior of the country in search of the lakes of Laconia.
This he finally attempted, but without success. Hubbard says that
“after three years spent in labor and travel for that end, or other fruitless
endeavors, and expense of too much estate, they returned back to England
with a <i>non est inventa Provincia</i>.” The Company also attempted to carry
on, in connection with the peltry business, the manufacture of clapboards
and pipe-staves, and the making of salt from sea-water. A fishing station
was also set up at the Isles of Shoals. Large quantities of truck-goods were
sent over, which were put off to advantage for furs brought to the factories
by the Indians. In order to afford the Company greater facilities, and to
secure to themselves what they had already gained, they had, on Nov. 3,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
1631, procured a grant from the Council of a tract of land on each side of
the Piscataqua River, in which the Isles of Shoals were included.</p>

<p>But success did not attend their operations. The returns were inadequate
to the outlay, and there was bad management and alleged bad faith
on the part of the employés; the larger part of the associates became discouraged,
and at the end of the third year they decided to proceed no
further till Captain Neal should return and report upon the condition of
affairs. Neal left Piscataqua July 15, 1633, and sailed from Boston in
August. His report was probably not encouraging, for the Company proceeded
later to wind up its affairs, and in December following they divided
their lands on the east side of the river. In May, 1634, a further division
was made, by which it appears that Gorges and Mason, by purchase from
their partners, had acquired one half of the shares; and of this part Mason
owned three fourths. Gibbons, their factor, was now directed to discharge
all the servants and pay them off in beaver. Mason next sent over a new
supply of men, and set up two saw-mills on his own portion of the lands;
but after this we have no account of anything being done by him or by any
other of the adventurers on the west side. Neither have we seen evidence
of any division of lands having been made on the west side. Hubbard says
that in some “after division” Little Harbor fell to Mason, who mentions
it in his will. But Mason in that instrument claims and bequeaths his
whole grant of New Hampshire of April 22, 1635, which included the part
mentioned by Hubbard. Mason died before the close of the year 1635.
What course was taken by his late partners or by the heirs of Mason
during the two following years, there are but few contemporary documents
to tell us. In 1638 Mrs. Mason, the executrix of John Mason’s estate, appointed
Francis Norton her general attorney to look after her interests in
those parts. But the expenses were found to be so great and the income
so small, and the servants were so clamorous for their arrears of pay, that
she was obliged to relinquish the care of the plantation, and tell the servants
to shift for themselves. Upon this they shared the goods and cattle,
while some kept possession of the buildings and improvements, claiming
them as their own. Charges were afterward brought against her agents
and servants for embezzling the estate. Some years later suits were
brought in her name and in that of the other proprietors in the courts of
Massachusetts against the inhabitants of Strawberry Bank and of Newichwaneck,
for encroaching upon the lands in the Laconia patent. As a
conclusion of this summary sketch of the Laconia Company, it may be
added that the records of the old Court of Requests of London show that,
on the dissolution of the Company, suits sprang up among the adventurers
themselves, which were for a long time in litigation.</p>

<p>After Captain Neal went to England the Company appointed Francis
Williams to be governor in his place. As Strawberry Bank (the place was
not called Portsmouth till 1653) had no efficient government during all this
time, the inhabitants now by a written instrument, signed by forty-one persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
formed a combination among themselves, as Dover had done, and
Francis Williams was continued governor. The people belonged principally
to the Church of England, and during this combination they set apart fifty
acres of land for a glebe, committing it in trust to two church wardens.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Reference has already been made to the successful attempts of the Massachusetts
Government to bring all the Piscataqua settlements under her jurisdiction.
The people of Strawberry Bank were as successfully wrought upon
as those of Dover were, and the same agreement of June 14, 1641, included
the submission of both, and certain proprietors named, in behalf of themselves
and of the other partners of the two patents, subscribed to the paper.</p>

<p>Of no one of the grants issued to John Mason, or in which he had a joint
interest, covering the territory of New Hampshire (except those connected
with the Laconia Company) did he make any improvement,&mdash;and these
grants were that of Aug. 10, 1622, with Gorges, between the Merrimac and
Sagadahoc; that of Nov. 7, 1629, between the Merrimac and the Piscataqua;
and that of April 22, 1635, between Naumkeag and the Piscataqua.
The territory now known as New Hampshire was never called by that
name, except by Mason in his last will, till 1661, when, through the discussions
consequent upon the claims of the heir of Mason, this designation
was introduced for the first time.</p>

<p>The independent settlement at Exeter was made in 1638 by John Wheelwright
and others; and of these pioneers Wheelwright himself with some
companions had been banished from Massachusetts in the previous year.
They bought their lands in April of that year from the Indians. On the
5th of June, 1639, they formed a combination as a church and as subjects of
King Charles, promising to submit to all laws to be made. It was signed
by thirty-one persons, of whom fourteen made their marks. In 1643 they
came under Massachusetts. The order of the General Court of that colony
recites, under date of September 7, that, finding themselves within
the bounds of Massachusetts, the inhabitants petitioned to be taken under
her jurisdiction. Wheelwright then removed to Wells, in the Province
of Maine.</p>

<p>Hampton, where the “bound-house” was built by Massachusetts in 1636,
was considered from the first as belonging to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.
A union having been thus formed between the settlements on the
Piscataqua River and its branches and the colony of Massachusetts, their
history for the next forty years is substantially the same. These plantations
were governed by the general laws of Massachusetts, and the terms of
union were strictly observed.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>But Massachusetts was destined to be arraigned by the heir of the old
patentee of New Hampshire, Robert Tufton Mason, who at the Restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
pressed his claim on the attention of the Crown. Finally, after a long
struggle, the judges in 1677 advised that Mason had no right to the government
of New Hampshire, but that the four towns of Portsmouth, Dover,
Exeter, and Hampton were beyond the bounds of Massachusetts, whose
northern boundary was thereby driven back to its old limits, while its charter
of 1629 was held to be valid. In 1679 a revised opinion was given by
the attorney, Jones, to the effect that Mason’s title to the soil must be tried
on the spot, where the ter-tenants could be summoned. A new government
was now instituted by the Crown for New Hampshire, and a commission
was issued to John Cutt as president for one year.</p>

<p>This form of government, the administration of which was arbitrary and
very unpopular throughout the province, continued till the time of Dudley
and Andros, whose commissions rode over all others preceding. On the
downfall of Andros New Hampshire was for a short time again united to
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Connecticut.</span>&mdash;Connecticut was settled in 1635 and 1636 by emigrants
from three towns in Massachusetts,&mdash;namely, Dorchester, Watertown, and
Newtown (Cambridge); those from Newtown arriving in 1636. Their
places of settlement on the Connecticut River bore for a while the names of
the towns in Massachusetts whence the emigrants came; but in February,
1637, the names of Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford were substituted.</p>

</div>

<p>The Rev. Thomas Hooker and the Rev. Samuel
Stone accompanied the people from Newtown. The
Rev. John Warham joined his people at Windsor, and the Rev. Henry Smith
was chosen pastor of the church at Wethersfield. These several communities,
though beyond the borders of Massachusetts, were instituted
under her protection, and for one year they were governed by a commission
issuing from the General Court of that colony. Springfield, settled in
1636, was in this commission united with the lower plantations. This provisional
arrangement was found to be inconvenient, and at the end of the
year the several towns took the government into their own hands, and a
General Court was held at Hartford, May 1, 1637. Preparations were now
made for the impending Pequot war, which called out all the strength of the
feeble settlements. On its conclusion, after arrangements had been made
for future security from savage foes, and for the purchase of food till the
new fields should become productive, the inhabitants of these towns&mdash;Springfield,
now suspected, and soon afterward declared, to be within the
bounds of Massachusetts, excepted&mdash;formed a constitution among themselves,
bearing date Jan. 14, 1638/39. This instrument has been called
“the first example in history of a written constitution,&mdash;a distinct organic
law constituting a government and defining its powers.”<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> It contained
no recognition of any external authority, and provided that all persons
should be freemen, who should be admitted as such by the freemen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the towns, and should take the oath of allegiance. It continued in force,
with little alteration, for one hundred and eighty years.</p>

he and Edward Hopkins
held the office during most
of the time for the next
fifteen years. In 1657
John Winthrop, son of
the Massachusetts governor, was chosen, and continued to serve till the
acceptance of the new charter by New Haven, when he was continued in
that office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,
in October, 1635,
this same John
Winthrop, Jr.,
had returned
from England
with a commission
from Lord
Say and Sele,
Lord Brook,
and others, their
associates, patentees
of Connecticut,
constituting
him “governor
of the River
Connecticut,
with the places
adjoining,” for
the space of one
whole year. He
was instructed
to build a fort
near the mouth
of the river, and
to erect habitations;
and he was
supplied with
means to carry out this purpose. He brought over with him one Lion
Gardiner, an expert engineer, who planned the fortifications, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
appointed lieutenant-governor of the fort. It was expected that a number
of “gentlemen of quality” would come over to the colony, and some disposition
was at first shown to remove the settlers of the towns on the river
who had “squatted” on the lands of the Connecticut patentees.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1639 George Fenwick, who was interested in the
patent, and his family came over in behalf of the patentees, and took possession
of the place, intending
to build a town near the
mouth of the river. A settlement
was made, and
named Saybrook, in honor
of the two principal patentees.
The government of
the town was entirely independent
of Connecticut till
1644/45, when Fenwick, as
agent of the proprietors,
transferred by contract to
that government the fort at
Saybrook and its appurtenances,
and the land upon
the river, with a pledge to
convey all the land thence
to Narragansett River, if it
came into his power to convey
it.</p>

<p>In 1638 a settlement was
made at Quinnipiack, afterward
called New Haven,
under the lead of John Davenport.
The emigrants,
principally from Massachusetts,&mdash;like
those of the river towns,&mdash;had no patent or title to the land
on which they planted, but made a number of purchases from the Indians.
Here, in April, under the shelter of an oak, they listened to a sermon by
Davenport, and a few days afterward formed a “plantation covenant,” as
preliminary to a more formal engagement,&mdash;all agreeing to be ordered by
the rule of Scripture. This colony, as well as that just described, sympathized
substantially in religious views with Massachusetts.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June, 1639, all the free planters met in a barn “to consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
about settling civil government according
to God.” Mr. Davenport prayed
and preached, and they then proceeded,
by his advice, to form a government.
They first decided that none but church
members should be free burgesses.
Twelve men were then chosen, who out
of their own number chose seven to
constitute a church and on the “seven
pillars” thus chosen rested also the responsibility
of forming the civil government.
On October 29 these seven persons
met, and, after a solemn address
to the Supreme Being, proceeded to
form the body of freemen, and to elect
their civil officers. Theophilus Eaton
was chosen to be governor for that
year; indeed, he continued to be rechosen
to the office for nearly twenty
years, till his death. This was the original,
fundamental constitution of New
Haven. A few general rules were adopted,
but no code of laws established.
The Word of God was to be taken as
the rule in all things.</p>

was adopted by New Haven, as drawn up by Governor Eaton, the manuscript
having been sent to England to be printed.</p>

<p>The old patent of Connecticut mentioned in the agreement with Fenwick
seems never to have been made over to the colony; and they were
very anxious, on the restoration of Charles II. in 1660, for a royal charter,
which would secure to them a continuance and confirmation of their rights
and privileges. Governor John Winthrop was appointed as agent to represent
the colony in England, for this purpose; and in April, 1662, he succeeded
in procuring a charter, which included the colony of New Haven.
The charter conveyed most ample powers and privileges for colonial
government, and confirmed or conveyed the whole tract of country which
had been granted to Lord Say and Sele and others. Mr. Davenport and
other leading men of that colony were entirely opposed to a union with
Connecticut; and the acceptance of the new charter was resisted till 1665,
when the opposition was overcome, and the colonies became united, and
at the general election in May of that year John Winthrop was elected
to be governor.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the church polity of Connecticut and New
Haven, from the beginning, was substantially that of Massachusetts. Their
clergymen assisted in framing the Cambridge Platform in 1648, which was
the guide of the churches for many years. Hooker’s <i>Survey</i> and Cotton’s
<i>Way of the Churches Cleared</i> (London, 1648) were published under one
general titlepage covering both works. After a few years the harmony
of the churches was seriously disturbed by a set of new opinions which
sprang up in the church at Hartford, and which finally culminated in the
adoption by a general council of Connecticut and Massachusetts churches,
held in Boston in 1657, of the “Half-Way Covenant.” New Haven held
aloof. Political motives lent their influence in the spread of the new views;
and while the government of Connecticut attempted to enforce the resolutions
of the synod, the churches long refused to comply.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The union of the two communities under one charter gave strength
to both, and the colony prospered, while Winthrop felt the strong control
of a robust spirit in John Allyn, the secretary of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of course constant occasions of annoyance and dissension, both civil and
religious. Their wily foe, the Indian, did not cease wholly to disturb their
repose. But during Philip’s
War, which was so disastrous
to Massachusetts, Plymouth,
and Rhode Island, there was
less suffering in Connecticut.
Conflicts of jurisdiction, both
east and west, growing out of
the uncertain boundaries of its grant, though it ran west to the South Sea,
were of long duration. No sooner had the commissioners, appointed by
the King in 1683, made a favorable decision for Connecticut in her controversy
with Rhode Island in regard to the Narragansett country, than a new
claimant arose. At the division of the grand patent in 1635, James, Marquis
of Hamilton, had assigned to him the country between the Connecticut
and the Narragansett rivers; but his claim slumbered only to be revived
by his heirs at the Restoration,&mdash;and now a second time, through Edward
Randolph, the watchful and untiring enemy of New England. The prior
grant to Lord Say and Sele, confirmed by the charter of April 23, 1662,
and the settlement of the country under it, was cited by Connecticut in
their answer; and, in an opinion on the case a few years later, Sir Francis
Pemberton said that the answer was a good one.</p>

<p>When James II. continued the attacks on the New England charters
begun by the late king, with a view to bring all the colonies under the
crown, Connecticut did not escape. A <i>quo warranto</i> was issued against
the Governor and Company in July, 1685, and this was followed by notices
to appear and defend; but the colony resisted, and petitioned, and final
judgment was never entered. The colony’s language to the King in one
of its addresses to him was, however, construed as a surrender. Andros
went from Boston to Hartford in October, 1687, and at a meeting of the
Assembly, which was prolonged till midnight, demanded its charter.
The story goes, that, by a bold legerdemain, the parchment, after the
lights were blown out, was spirited away and hidden in the hollow of an
oak-tree; nevertheless Andros assumed the government of the colony,
under his commission. Thus matters continued till the Revolution of
1689, when the colony resumed its charter.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Rhode Island.</span>&mdash;Rhode Island was settled by Roger Williams in
1636, he having been banished from Massachusetts the year before. Professor
George Washington Greene, in his <i>Short History of Rhode Island</i>,
remarks, that in the settlement of the New England colonies the religious
idea lay at the root of their foundation and development; that in Plymouth
it took the form of separation, or a simple severance from the Church
of England; in Massachusetts Bay it aimed at the establishment of a
theocracy and the enforcement of a vigorous uniformity of creed and discipline;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and that from the resistance to this uniformity came Rhode Island
and the doctrine of soul-liberty.</p>

<p>Williams was banished from Massachusetts principally for political reasons.
His peculiar opinions relating to soul-liberty were not fully developed
until after he had taken up his residence in Rhode Island. Five persons accompanied
him to the banks of the Mooshausic, and there they planted the
town of Providence. Williams here purchased, or received by gift, a tract
of land from the Indians, and he had no patent or other title to the soil.
Additions were soon made to the little settlement, and he divided the land
with twelve of his companions, reserving for them and himself the right
of extending the grant to others who might be admitted to fellowship. An
association of civil government was formed among the householders or
masters of families, who agreed to be governed by the orders of the
greater number. This was followed by another agreement of non-householders
or single persons, who agreed to subject themselves to such orders
as should be made by the householders, but “only in civil things.” This
latter is the earliest agreement on the records of the colony. In 1639, to
meet the wants of an increasing community, five disposers or selectmen
were chosen, charged with political duties,&mdash;their actions being subject to
revision by the superior authority of the town meetings.</p>

         title="" />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile two other colonies had been planted on the shores of Narragansett
Bay. The first, partly from the ranks of the Antinomians of
Massachusetts, led by William
Coddington and John Clarke,
who settled at Pocasset (Portsmouth),
in the northern part
of the Island of Aquedneck in
March, 1637/38; and their number so increased that in the following year,
1639, a portion of them moved to the south part of the island, and settled
the town of Newport. Like Roger Williams, the settlers had no other title
to the land than what was obtained from the natives. Another colony was
planted at Shawomet (Warwick), in January, 1642/43, by Samuel Gorton,&mdash;a
notorious disturber of the peace,&mdash;with about a dozen followers, who
also secured an Indian title to their lands. Gorton had been in Boston,
Plymouth, Portsmouth, and in Providence, and was an unwelcome resident
in all, and at Portsmouth he had been whipped.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-336b.jpg" width="200" height="81" id="i336b"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>About 1640, with some
followers, he came to Pawtuxet, in the south part
of Providence, and, taking sides in some previous
land quarrel there, prevailed. The weaker party
appealed to Massachusetts for protection, and
finally subjected themselves and their lands to that government; upon
which Gorton and his followers fled south to Shawomet. Soon afterward,
by the surrender to Massachusetts of a subordinate Indian chief, who
claimed the territory there, purchased by Gorton of Miantonomi, that
Government made a demand of jurisdiction there also; and as Gorton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
refused their summons to appear at Boston, Massachusetts sent soldiers,
and captured the inhabitants in their homes, took them to Boston, tried
them, and sentenced the greater part of them to imprisonment for blasphemous
language to the Massachusetts authorities. They were finally
liberated, and banished; and as Warwick was included in the forbidden
territory, they went to Rhode Island. Gorton and two of his friends soon
afterward went to England.</p>

<p>The inhabitants on the island formed themselves into a voluntary association
of government, as they had done at Providence. The community
at Warwick was at first without any form of government.</p>

<p>Feeling a sense of a common danger, the little settlements of Providence
and Rhode Island sent Roger Williams to England, in 1643, to apply for
a charter. He found the King at open war with the Parliament; but
from the Parliamentary commissioners, with the Earl of Warwick at their
head, he procured a charter of “Incorporation of Providence Plantations
in the Narragansett Bay in New England,” dated March 14, 1643; that is,
1644 (N. S.). Three years were allowed to pass before the charter was formally
accepted by the plantations; but in May, 1647, the corporators met
at Portsmouth, and organized a government; and Warwick, whither Gorton
and his followers had now returned, though not named in the charter, was
admitted to its privileges. This franchise was a charter of incorporation,
as its title indicates; but it contained no grant of land. It recites the purchase
of lands from the natives; and the Government under it claimed the
exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title to lands still owned by the
tribes within its boundaries. The code of laws adopted when the charter
was accepted is an attempt to codify the common and statute laws
of England, or such parts as were thought binding or would suit their
condition.</p>

<p>Williams’s principle of liberty of conscience was sometimes interpreted
in the community to mean freedom from civil restraint, and harmony did
not always prevail. This gave cause to his enemies to exult, while his
friends feared lest their hope of reconciling liberty and law should fail.</p>

<p>The attempt of Massachusetts to bring the territory of the colony under
her jurisdiction was a source of great annoyance. During this contest an
appeal to the authorities in England resulted in the triumph of the weaker
colony. Then came the “Coddington usurpation,”&mdash;an unexplained episode
in the history of Rhode Island, by which the island towns in 1651
were severed from the government of the colony; and Coddington, by a
commission from the Council of State in England, was made governor for
life. This revolution seemed for a time successful; but the friends of the
colony did not despair. Williams and John Clarke were sent to England
as agents,&mdash;the one in behalf of the former charter, and the other to ask
for a revocation of Coddington’s commission. They were both successful;
and in the following year the old civil <i>status</i> was fully restored.</p>

<p>As civil dissensions ceased, there was danger of another Indian war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
which for the time was arrested by the sagacity of Williams. The refusal
of the United Colonies to admit Rhode Island to their confederacy placed
her at great disadvantage. Yet though causes of dissension remained, the
colony grew in industry and strength. Newport especially increased in
population and in wealth. Not every inhabitant, however, was a freeman.
The suffrage was restricted to ownership in land, and there was a long
process of initiation to be passed through before a candidate could be
admitted to full citizenship.</p>

<p>Changes were taking place in England. Cromwell died, and his son
Richard soon afterward resigned the Protectorship. The restoration of
Charles II. followed by acclamation. The colony hastened to acknowledge
the new King; the acts of the Long Parliament were abrogated, and a new
charter was applied for through John Clarke, who still remained in England.
This instrument, dated Nov. 24, 1663, was evidently drawn up by Clarke,
or was prepared under his supervision. It confirmed to the inhabitants
freedom of conscience in matters of religion. It recounted the purchase of
the land from the natives,
but it equally asserted the
royal prerogative and the
ultimate dominion of the
lands in the Crown,&mdash;a provision
which Williams had
strenuously objected to and
preached against in the Massachusetts
charter. The
holding was from the King,
as of the manner of East
Greenwich. This gave the
colony, in English law, an
absolute title to the soil as
against any foreign State or
its subjects. It operated practically
as a pre-emptive right
to extinguish the Indian
title. The charter created a
corporation by the name of
“The Governor and Company
of the English Colony
of Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations in New England in America.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>This charter gave the whole of the Narragansett country to the colony,
which the year before had been given to Connecticut; but it did not bring
peace. That colony still clamored for her charter boundary; while a body
of land speculators from Massachusetts, known as the Atherton Company,
who had, in violation of Rhode Island law, bought lands at Quidnesett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and Namcook, now insisted upon being placed under Connecticut jurisdiction.
The King’s commissioners, who arrived in the country in 1664,
charged with the duty of settling all disputes, came into Rhode Island.
They received the submission of the Narragansett chiefs to the King,
confirmatory of the same act performed in 1644, and they set apart the
Narragansett country, extending from the bay to the Pawcatuck River,
and named it King’s Province, and established a royal government over it.
Some other matters in dispute were happily settled. The royal commissioners
were well satisfied with the conduct of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The colony still grew, but it continued poor. About the year 1663
schools were established in Providence,&mdash;a tardy following of Newport,
which had employed a teacher in 1640. The colony was kept poor by
the great expense incurred in employing agents to defend itself from the
surrounding colonies, that wished to crush it. But another trouble arose.
A fearful war was impending, the bloodiest which the colony had yet
waged with the Indians. We have no space for the story; but Philip’s
War fell most heavily on Rhode Island, which furnished troops, but was
not consulted as to its management. Peace was at length restored, and
the Indians subdued; though they were still turbulent.</p>

<p>Connecticut had not yet renounced her claims on the Narragansett country.
Rhode Island set up her authority in the province, and appointed officers
for its government. Both colonies appealed to the King. Within the
colony itself now arose a
most bitter controversy
respecting the limits and
extent of the original Providence
and Pawtuxet purchase,
which was not finally
settled till the next century.
It grew out of the careless
manner in which Roger Williams worded the deeds to himself from the
Indians, and also those which he himself gave to the colony.</p>

<p>The appeal of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the King resulted in a
commission, in 1683, headed by the notorious Cranfield, Governor of New
Hampshire, and including the no less notorious Edward Randolph. They
quarrelled with the authorities of Rhode Island, and decided in favor of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>In due time Rhode Island was a common sufferer with the rest of New
England, under the imposition of Andros and his commission. He came
into Rhode Island, and was kindly received. He broke the colony seal,
but the parchment charter was put beyond his reach. The colony surrendered,
and petitioned the King to preserve her charter, and then fell back
upon a provisional government of the towns. At the revolution she resumed
her charter, and later it was decided in England that it had never been revoked
and remained in full force.</p>

<h3><a name="c340" id="c340">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04"><span class="smcap">THE Council for New England.</span>&mdash;Chalmers, <i>Annals</i>, 1780, p. 99, says concerning
the great patent of Nov. 3, 1620, “This patent which has never been printed
because so early surrendered, is in the old entries of New England in the Plant. off.” I
saw the parchment enrolment of this charter in her Majesty’s Public Record Office, in
Fetter Lane, London, and described it in full in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, for April, 1867,
p. 54. It was first printed by Hazard, <i>Historical Collections</i>, vol. i. 1792, pp. 103-118,
probably from a manuscript copy in the Superior Court files, N. H.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>The petition of the Northern Colony for a new charter, dated March 3, 1619/20, and
the warrant to his Majesty’s Solicitor-General to prepare such a patent, dated July 23,
1620, may be seen in Brodhead’s <i>Documents</i>, etc., iii. 2-4. The warrant is also in Gorges’
<i>Briefe Narration</i>, p. 21.</p>

<p>The opposition of the Virginia Company to the granting of this patent may be seen in
their records as published by Neill., <i>History of the Virginia Company of London</i>, 1869, <i>passim</i>;
also in Gorges’ <i>Briefe Narration</i>, pp. 22-31; in the Council’s Briefe Relation,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> pp.
18-22; and in Brodhead’s <i>Documents</i>, iii. 4. The opposition of the House of Commons to
the patent, after it had passed the seals, may be best seen in the printed <i>Journals of the
House</i> for the sessions of 1621 and 1624. Chalmers’ extracts are to the point, but are not
full. See also Gorges, and the <i>Briefe Relation</i>, as above. For the answer to the French
ambassador, see also Sainsbury’s <i>Calendar, Colonial</i>, p. 61. The history of the transactions
of the Council may be largely gathered from their extant records as published in
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, for April, 1867, and for October, 1875; from Gorges, and from
the <i>Briefe Relation</i>. Cf. Palfrey, i. 193.</p>

<p>Probably no complete record exists of all the patents issued by the Council; and of
those known to have been granted, the originals, or even copies of all of them, are not
known to be extant. As full a list of these as has been collected may be seen in a Lecture
read before the Massachusetts Historical Society, Jan. 15, 1869, by Samuel F. Haven,
LL. D., entitled <i>History of Grants under the Great Council for New England</i>, etc.,&mdash;a
valuable paper with comments and explanations, with which compare Dr. Palfrey’s list in
his <i>History of New England</i>, i. 397-99.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Since Dr. Palfrey wrote, new material has come
to light respecting some of these grants. The patent of Aug. 10, 1622, which Dr. Belknap
supposed was the Laconia patent, and which he erroneously made the basis of the settlements
of Thomson and of the Hiltons, and of later operations on the Piscataqua, is
found not to be the Laconia patent, which was issued seven years later, namely, Nov. 17,
1629.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Later writers have copied him. Again, Dr. Palfrey refers the early division of the
territory by the Council, from the Bay of Fundy to Cape Cod, among twenty associates, to
May 31, 1622. By the recovery of another fragment of the records of the Council in 1875,
we are able to correct all previous errors respecting that division, which really took place
on Sunday, July 29, 1623. This fact has appeared since Dr. Haven wrote.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>An object of interest would be the map of the country on which the different patents
granted were marked off. Some idea from it might be formed of the geographical mistakes
by which one grant overlapped another, or swallowed it up entirely. I know of no
published map existing at that time that would have served the purpose. The names of
the places on the coast from Penobscot to Cape Cod, mentioned by Captain Smith in his
tract issued in 1616, were rarely indicated on his map which accompanied the tract.
They had been laid down on the manuscript draft of the map, but were changed for English
names by Prince Charles.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Quite likely the Council had manuscript maps of the
coast. Of the division of 1623, the records say it was resolved that the land “be divided
according as the division is made in the plot remaining with Dr. Goche.” Smith, speaking
of this division, says that the country was at last “engrossed by twenty patentees, that
divided my map into twenty parts, and cast lots for their shares,” etc. Smith’s map was
probably the best published map of the coast which existed at that time; but the map on
which the names were subsequently engrossed and published was Alexander’s map of
New England, New France, and New Scotland, published in 1624, in his <i>Encouragement
to Colonies</i>, and also issued in the following year in Purchas, vol. iv. p. 1872. This
record, as the fac-simile shows,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> is a mere huddling together of names, with no indication
as to a division of the country, as it was not possible there should be on such a map as
this, where the whole New England coast, as laid down, is limited to three inches in
extent, with few natural features delineated upon it.</p>

<p>The greatest trouble existed among the smaller patents. A large patent, like that to
Gorges, for instance, at the grand division, with well-defined natural boundaries on the
coast, between the Piscataqua and the Sagadahoc, or the Penobscot, would not be likely
to be contested for lack of description; but there had been many smaller patents issued
within these limits, which ran into and overlapped each other, and some were so completely
annihilated as to cause great confusion.</p>

<p>Some of these smaller patents had alleged powers of government granted to the
settlers,&mdash;powers probably rarely exercised by virtue of such a grant, and which
the Council undoubtedly had no authority to confer.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The people of Plymouth, for
instance, in their patent of 1630, were authorized, in the language of the grant, to incorporate
themselves by some usual or fit name and title, with liberty to make laws
and ordinances for their government. They never had a royal charter of incorporation
during their separate existence, though they strove hard to obtain one. The Council
for New England might from the first have taken the Pilgrims under their own government
and protection; and Governor Bradford, in letters to the Council and to Sir
Ferdinando Gorges, written in 1627 and 1628, acknowledges that relation, and asks for
their aid.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

NEW ENGLAND.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The records of the Council, so far as they are extant, contain no notice of the adoption
of a common seal, and we are ignorant as to the time of its adoption. In the earliest patent
known to have been issued by the Council, which was an indenture between them and
John Peirce and his associates, dated June 1, 1621, the language is, “In witness whereof
the said President and Council have to the one part of this present Indenture set their
seals.” This is signed first by the Duke of Lenox, who I think was the first President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of the Council, and by five other members of the Council, with the private seal of each
appended to his signature. But in a grant to Gorges and Mason, of Aug. 10, 1622,
which is also an indenture, the language is, that to one part “the said President and
Council have caused their <i>common seal</i> to be affixed.”
Here we have a “common seal” used by the Council
in issuing their subsequent grants. But it is very singular,
that of the many original grants of the Council
extant no one of them has the wax impression of the
seal intact or unbroken; usually it is wholly wanting.
It is believed, however, that the design of the seal has
been discovered in the engraving on the titlepage of
Smith’s <i>Generall Historie</i>; and the reasons for this opinion
may be seen in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, March, 1867,
pp. 469-472.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> A delineation of it is given herewith.</p>

<p>In the absence of any record of the organization of
the Council, or of any rules or by-laws for the transaction
of its business, we do not know what officers, or
what number of the Council, were required for the issuing
of patents, or for authorizing the use of the Company’s
seal. The only name signed to the Plymouth
Patent of Jan. 13, 1629/30 is that of the Earl of Warwick, who was then the President of
the Council.</p>

known, it is the first grant of any moment made after the general division in 1623, but
probably it was preceded by the license to the Plymouth people of privileges on the Kennebec.
This patent to the Massachusetts Colony is not extant, but it is recited in the
subsequent charter. There is some mystery attending the manner of its procurement, as
well as about its extent. The business was managed, in the absence of Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, by the Earl of Warwick, who was friendly to the patentees.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The royal charter of
Massachusetts was dated March 4, 1628 (O.S.). For the forms used in issuing it, see
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, December, 1869, pp. 167-196. A discussion of the charter itself
as a frame of government for a commonwealth is found in Hutchinson’s <i>History of Massachusetts</i>,
i. 414, 415; Judge Parker’s Lecture before the Massachusetts Historical Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Feb. 9, 1869, entitled <i>The First Charter</i>, etc.; and <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i. 329-382,
and the authorities there cited. As to the right of the Company to transfer the government
and charter to the soil, see Judge Parker, as above; Dr. Palfrey, <i>New England</i>,
i. 301-308; Barry, <i>History of Massachusetts</i>, i. 174-186, and the authorities cited by them.
The original charter, on parchment, is in the State House in Boston. A heliotype of a
section of it is given in the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i. 329.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The duplicate or
exemplification of the charter, which was originally sent over to Endicott in 1629, is now
in the Library of the Salem Athenæeum. The charter was first printed, and from the
“<i>dupl.</i>” parchment, “by S. Green, for Benj. Harris, at the London Coffee-House, near the
Town-House, in Boston, 1689.” It is entitled <i>A Copy of the Massachusetts Charter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>The archives of the State are rich in the materials of its history. The records of the
government from its first institution in England down to the overthrow of the charter are
almost a history in themselves. The student is no longer required to decipher the ancient
writing, for in 1853-54 the Records were copied and printed under the editorial care of
Dr. N. B. Shurtleff.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> A large mass of manuscripts remains at the State House, and is
known as the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i>. The papers were classified by the late Joseph B.
Felt.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> They are the constant resource of antiquaries and historians, few of whom, however,

The City of Boston, by its Record Commission, is making accessible in print most valuable
material which has long slumbered in manuscript. The Archives of the Massachusetts
Historical Society are specially rich in early manuscripts, a catalogue of which is
now preparing, and its publishing committees are constantly at work converting their
manuscripts into print, while the sixty-seven volumes of its publications, as materials of
history, are without a rival.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The first general <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i> was written by Thomas Hutchinson,
afterward governor of the province, in two volumes, the first of which, covering the period
ending with the downfall of Andros, was published in Boston in 1764. The second volume,
bringing the history down to 1750, was published in 1767. Each volume was issued
in London in the year following its publication here. The author had rich materials for
his work, and was judicious in the use of them. He had a genius for history, and his
book will always stand as of the highest authority. A volume of <i>Original Papers</i>, which
illustrate the first volume of the history, was published in 1769.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Hutchinson died in
England in 1780. Among his manuscripts was found a continuation of his history, vol.
iii., bringing the events down to 1774, in which year he left the country. This was printed
in London in 1828.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Some copies of vol. i., London ed., were wrongly dated MDCCLX.</p>

<p>In 1798 was published, in two volumes, a continuation of Hutchinson’s second volume,
by George Richards Minot,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> bringing the history down to 1764. The work was left unfinished,
and Alden Bradford, in 1822-1829, published, in three volumes, a continuation
of that to the year 1820.</p>

<p>The next most considerable attempt at a general <i>History of Massachusetts</i> was by John
Stetson Barry, who published three volumes in 1855-1857. It is a valuable work, written
from the best authorities, and comes down to 1820.</p>

<p>Palfrey’s <i>History of New England</i>, the first three volumes of which were published
in 1858-1864, and cover the period ending with the downfall of Andros, must be regarded
altogether as the best history of this section of our country yet written, as well for its
luminous text as for the authorities in its notes.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>I will now go back and mention a few other general histories of New England, including
those works in which the history of Massachusetts is a prominent feature.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather’s <i>Ecclesiastical History of New England</i>, better known as his <i>Magnalia</i>,
from the head-line of the titlepage, <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i>, was published
in London in 1702, in folio. Although relating generally to New England, it principally
concerns Massachusetts. While the book is filled with the author’s conceits and puns,
and gives abundant evidence of his credulity, it contains a vast amount of valuable historical
material, and is indispensable in any New England library. It is badly arranged
for consultation, for it is largely a compilation from the author’s previous publications, and
it lacks an index. It has been twice reprinted,&mdash;in 1820 and 1853.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>John Oldmixon, Collector of Customs at Bridgewater, England, compiled and published
at London, in 1708, his <i>British Empire in America</i>, in two volumes. About one
hundred pages of the first volume relate to New England, and while admitting that he
drew on Cotton Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> for most of his material, omitting the puns, anagrams,
etc., the author nevertheless vents his spleen on this book of the Boston divine.
Mather was deeply hurt by this indignity, and he devoted the principal part of the Introduction
to his <i>Parentator</i>, 1724, to this ill-natured writer. He says he found in eighty-six
pages of Oldmixon’s book eighty-seven falsehoods. A second edition of <i>The British
Empire in America</i> was published in 1741, with considerable additions and alterations.
In the mean time the Rev. Daniel Neal had published in London his <i>History of New
England</i>, which led Oldmixon to rewrite, for this new edition, his chapters relating to
New England. Oldmixon’s work is of little value. He was careless and unscrupulous.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Neal’s <i>History of New England</i>, already mentioned, first appeared in 1720, in
two volumes, but was republished with additions in 1747.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> It contains a map “according
to the latest observations,” or, as he elsewhere observes, “done from the latest surveys,”
in one corner of which is an interesting miniature map of “The Harbour of Boston.”
This book must have supplied a great want at the time of its appearance, and though
Hutchinson says it is little more than an abridgment of Dr. Mather’s history,&mdash;which is
not quite true, as see his authorities in the Preface,&mdash;it gave in an accessible form many
of the principal facts concerning the beginning of New England. It of course relates
principally to Plymouth and Massachusetts. Neal was an independent thinker, and
differed essentially from Cotton Mather on many subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rev. Thomas Prince published in Boston in 1736 A <i>Chronological History of
New England in the Form of Annals</i>, in one volume, 12º, of about four hundred pages.
The author begins with the creation of the world, and devotes the last two hundred and
fifty pages to New England, coming down only to September, 1630, or to the settlement of
Boston. After an interval of about twenty years the work was resumed, and three numbers,
of thirty-two pages each, of vol. ii. were issued in 1755, bringing the chronology
down to August, 1633, when for want of sufficient encouragement the work ceased.
Prince was very particular in giving his authorities for every statement, and he professed
to quote the very language of his author.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>In 1749 was published the first volume of a <i>Summary, Historical and Political, ...
of the British Settlements in North America</i>, by William Douglass, M.D. The book had
been issued in numbers, beginning in January, 1747. The titlepage of the second volume
bears date 1751. The author died suddenly Oct. 21, 1752, before his work was finished.
A large part of the book relates to New England. It contains a good deal of valuable
information from original sources, but it is put together without system or order, and the
whole work appears more like a mass of notes hastily written than like a history. Dr.
Douglass was a Scotchman by birth, and coming to Boston while a young man, he
attained a reputable standing as a physician. In the small-pox episode in 1721 he
took an active part as an opposer of inoculation. He was fond of controversy, was
thoroughly honest and fearless, and gave offence in his <i>Summary</i> by his freedom of
speech. The <i>Summary</i> was republished in London in 1755 and in 1760, each edition
with a large map.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> The Boston edition was reissued with a new title, dated 1753.</p>

others of great value the reader is referred to Dr. Alexander Young’s <i>Chronicles of the
First Planters of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay</i>,&mdash;a convenient manual for reference,
of the highest authority, containing ample bibliographical notes and illustrations, which
need not be repeated here. This book, which was published in 1846, was unfortunately
thrown into chapters as of one narrative, as had been that relating to the Plymouth Colony,
published in 1841, whereby the original authorities, which should be the prominent
feature of the book, are subordinated to an editorial plan.</p>

<p>For the original authorities of the history of the scattered settlements in Massachusetts
Bay, prior to the Winthrop emigration, I cannot do better than refer to a paper on
the “Old Planters,”

<p>In Captain
John Smith’s <i>Advertisements
for
the unexperienced
Planters of New
England, or anywhere</i>,
London, 1631, he has two
chapters (xi. and xii.) on the settlement of Salem and Charlton (Charlestown), and an
account of the sad condition of the colony for months after the Winthrop emigration.
This is Smith’s last book, and his best in a literary point of view, and was published the
year of his death.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>The <i>New England’s Prospect</i>, by William Wood, London, 1634, is the earliest topographical
account of the Massachusetts Colony, so far as the settlements then extended.
It also has a full description of its fauna and flora, and of the natives. It is a valuable
book, and is written in vigorous and idiomatic English. The writer lived here four years,
returning to England Aug. 15, 1633. His book is entered in the Stationers’ Register,
“7 Julii, 1634.” Alonzo Lewis, author of the <i>History of Lynn</i>, thinks that he came over
again to the colony in 1635, as a person of that name arrived that year in the
“Hopewell.”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>New English Canaan</i>, by Thomas Morton, Amsterdam, 1637, “written upon ten
years’ knowledge and experiment of the country,” is a sort of satire upon the Plymouth
and Massachusetts people, who looked upon the author as a reprobate and an outlaw. He
came over, probably, with Weston’s company in 1622, and on the breaking up of that settlement
may have gone back to England. In 1625 he is found here again with Captain
Wollaston’s company on a plantation at “Mount Wollaston,” where he had his revels.
He was twice banished the country, and before his final return hither wrote this book.
His description of the natural features of the country, and his account of the native inhabitants
are of considerable interest and value, and the side-light which he throws upon the
Pilgrim and Puritan colonies will serve at least to amuse the reader.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Morton’s book,
though printed in Holland “in the yeare 1637,” was entered in the Stationers’ Register in
London, “Nov. 18, 1633,” in the name of Charles Greene as publisher; and a copy of the
book is now (1882) in the library of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts, 19 Delahay Street, Westminster, London, bearing this imprint: “Printed for
Charles Greene, and are sold in Paul’s Church-Yard;” no date, but “1632” written in with
a pen. See White Kennett’s <i>Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordia</i>, p. 77, where this copy
is entered, and where the manuscript date is printed in the margin. This date is, of course,
an error.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Morton’s book was not written till after the publication of Wood’s <i>New England’s
Prospect</i>, to which reference is frequently
made in the <i>New English Canaan</i>.
The <i>New England’s Prospect</i> was entered at
the Stationers’, “7 Julii, 1634,” and was published
the same year. Morton’s book is dedicated
to the Commissioners for Foreign
Plantations,&mdash;a body not created till April
28, 1634. The book must have been entered
at the Stationers’ some time in anticipation of
its printing; and when printed, some copies
were struck off bearing the imprint of Charles
Greene, though only one copy is now known
with his name on the titlepage.</p>

<p>The first serious trouble with the Indians,
which had been brewing for some years, culminated
in 1637, when the Pequots were annihilated.
This produced a number of narrations, two of which were published at the time,
and in London,&mdash;one by Philip Vincent,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> in 1637, and one by Captain John Underhill, in
1638.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> The former is not known to have been in New England at the time, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
minute particulars of his narrative would lead one to suppose that he had been in close
communication with some persons who had been in the conflict. He could hardly have
been present himself. Captain John Underhill, the writer of the second tract, was commander
of the Massachusetts forces at the storming of the fort, so that he narrates much
of what he saw. He prefaces his account with a description of the country, and of the
origin of the troubles with the Pequots. Both these narratives are reprinted in 3 <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vi.</p>

<p>I may add here that there were other narratives of the Pequot War written by actors in
it. A narrative by Major John Mason, the commander of the Connecticut forces, was left
by him on his death, in manuscript, and was communicated by his grandson to the Rev.
Thomas Prince, who published it in 1736. It is the best account of the affair written.
Some two or three years after the death of Mason, Mr. Allyn, the Secretary of the colony
of Connecticut, sent a narrative of the Pequot War to Increase Mather, who published it
in his <i>Relation of the Troubles</i>, etc., 1677, as of Allyn’s composition. Having no preface
or titlepage, Mather did not know that it was written by Major Mason, as was afterward
fully explained by Prince, who had the entire manuscript from Mason’s grandson.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>Lyon Gardiner, commander of the Saybrook fort during the Pequot War, also wrote
an account of the action, prefacing it with a narrative of recollections of earlier events.
It was written in his old age. It was first printed in 3 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, iii. 136-160.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>For the history of the Antinomian controversy which broke out about this time and
convulsed the whole of New England, see the examination of Mrs. Hutchinson in Hutchinson’s
<i>Massachusetts Bay</i>, ii. 482; Welde’s <i>Short Story</i>, etc., London, 1644; Chandler’s
<i>Criminal Trials</i>, Boston, 1841, vol. i.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>A small quarto volume published in London in 1641, entitled <i>An Abstract of the
Lawes of New England as they are now Established</i>, was one of the results of an attempt
to form a body of standing laws for the colony. I may premise, that, at the first meeting of
the Court of Assistants at Charlestown, certain rules of proceeding in civil actions were
established, and powers for punishing offenders instituted. In the former case equity
according to circumstances was the rule; and in punishing offences they professed to be
governed by the judicial laws of Moses where such laws were of a moral nature.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> But
such proceedings were arbitrary and uncertain, and the body of the people were clamorous
for a code of standing laws. John Cotton had been requested to assist in framing such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
code, and in October, 1636, he handed in to the General Court a copy of a body of laws
that he had compiled “in an exact method,” called “Moses his Judicials,” which the
Court took into consideration till the next meeting. The subject occupied attention from
year to year, till in December, 1641, the General Court established a body of one hundred
laws, called the Body of Liberties, which had been composed
by the Rev. Nathaniel Ward,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> of Ipswich. No copy of these
laws was known to have been preserved on the records of
the colony; and of the earliest printed digest of the laws, in
1648, which no doubt substantially conformed to the Body of Liberties, no copy is extant.</p>

         alt=""

</div>

<p>The <i>Abstract</i> above recited, published in 1641, was therefore for many years regarded
as the Body of Liberties, or an abstract of them, passed in that year. About forty years
ago Francis C. Gray, Esq., noticed in the library of the Boston Athenæum a manuscript
code of laws entitled “A Copy of the Liberties of the Massachusetts Colonie in New
England,” which he caused to be printed in 3 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, viii. 216-237, with a
learned introduction, in which he showed conclusively that this body of laws was the code
of 1641, and that the <i>Abstract</i> printed that year in London was John Cotton’s code, <i>Moses
his Judicials</i>, which the General Court never adopted. A copy having found its way to
England, it was sent to the press under a misapprehension, and an erroneous titlepage
prefixed to it. Indeed, that John Cotton was the author of the code published in London
in 1641 had been evident from an early period, by means of a second and enlarged edition
published in London by William Aspinwall in 1655, from a manuscript copy left by the
author. Aspinwall, then in England, in a long address to the reader, says that Cotton
collected out of the Scriptures, and digested this <i>Abstract</i>, and commended it to the Court
of Massachusetts, “which had they then had the heart to have received, it might have
been better both with them there and us here than now it is.” The <i>Abstract</i> of 1641, with
Aspinwall’s preface to the edition of 1655, was reprinted in 1 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 173-192.
Hutchinson, <i>Papers</i>, 1769, pp. 161-179, had already printed the former.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>The religious character of the colony was exemplified by the publication, in 1640, of
the first book issued from the Cambridge press, set up by Stephen Daye the year before;
namely, <i>The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre</i>, by
Richard Mather, Thomas Welde, and John Eliot. Prince, in the preface to his revised
edition of this book, 1758, says that it “had the honor of being the <i>First Book</i> printed in
North America, and, as far as I can find, in this <i>whole</i> <span class="smcap">New World</span>.” Prince was not
aware that a printing press had existed in the City of Mexico one hundred years before.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
He was right, however, in the first part of his sentence. Eight copies of the book are
known to be extant, of which two are in Cambridge, where it was printed. Within a year
or two a copy has been sold for fifteen hundred dollars.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The first thing printed by Daye
was the freeman’s oath, the next was an almanac made for New England by Mr. William
Peirce, mariner,&mdash;so says Winthrop. What enterprising explorer of garrets and cellars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
will add copies of these to our collections of Americana? Probably one of the last books
printed by Daye was the first digest of the laws of the colony, which was passing through
the press in 1648. Johnson says it was printed that year. Probably 1649 was the date
on the titlepage. Not a single copy is known to be in existence. Daye was succeeded
in 1649 by Samuel Green, who issued books from the Cambridge press for nearly fifty
years.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and authentic of the early narratives relating to the colony
is Thomas Lechford’s <i>Plain Dealing</i>, London, 1642. Lechford came over here in 1638,
arriving June 27, and he embarked for home Aug. 3, 1641. He was a lawyer by profession,
and he came here with friendly feelings toward the Puritan settlement. But lawyers
were not wanted in the colony. He was looked upon with suspicion, and could barely earn
a living for his family. He did some writing for the magistrates, and transcribed some
papers for Nathaniel Ward, the supposed author of the Body of Liberties, to whom he may
have rendered professional aid in that work. He prepared his book for the press soon
after his return home. It is full of valuable information relating to the manners and
customs of the colony, written by an able and impartial hand.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>To the leading men in the colony, religion, or their own notion concerning religion,
was the one absorbing theme; and they sought to embody it in a union of Church and
State. In this regard John Cotton<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> seems to have been the mouthpiece of the community.
He came near losing his influence at the time of the Antinomian controversy but by
judicious management he recovered himself. He was not averse to discussion, had
a passion for writing, and his pen was ever active. The present writer has nearly thirty
of Cotton’s books,&mdash;the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> shows over forty,&mdash;written in New
England, and sent to London to be printed. Some of these were in answer to inquiries
from London concerning their church estate, etc., here, and were intended to satisfy the
curiosity of friends, as well as to influence public opinion there. Cotton had a long
controversy with Roger Williams relating to the subject of Williams’s banishment from
this colony. Another discussion with him, which took a little different form, was the
“Bloudy Tenet” controversy, which had another origin, and in which the question of
persecution for conscience’ sake was discussed. Williams, of course, here had the argument
on the general principle. Cotton was like a strong man struggling in the mire.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
Cotton’s book on the <i>Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</i> shows his idea of the true church
polity. His answer to Baylie’s <i>Dissuasive</i> in <i>The Way of the Congregational Churches
Cleared</i> is really a valuable historical book, in which, incidentally, he introduces information
concerning persons and events which relate to Plymouth as well as to Massachusetts.
This book furnished to the present writer the clew to the fact that John Winthrop was the
author of the principal part of the contents of Welde’s <i>Short Story</i>, published in London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
in 1644, relating to the Antinomian troubles and Mrs. Hutchinson. The Rev. Thomas
Hooker, of Hartford, entered with Cotton into the church controversy. His <i>Survey of the
Summe of Church Discipline</i>, etc., written in answer to Rutherford, Hudson, and Baylie,
Presbyterian controversialists, was published within the same cover with Cotton’s book
last cited, and one general titlepage covered both, with the imprint of London, 1648.</p>

<p>Well known among Cotton’s other productions is his <i>Milk for Babes, drawn out of the
Breasts of both Testaments, chiefly for the Spiritual Nourishment of Boston Babes in
either England, but may be of like Use for any Children</i>, London, 1646.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>The discussion
of Cotton and others having confirmed the colony in its church polity,&mdash;“From New
England,” says Baylie, writing in London in 1645, “came Independency of Churches
hither, which hath spread over all parts here,”&mdash;it was thought best to embody the
system in a platform. So a synod was called for May, 1646, which by sundry meetings
and adjournments completed the work in August, 1648. The result was the famous
“Cambridge Platform,” which continued the rule of our ecclesiastical polity, with slight
variations, till the adoption of the constitution of 1780. It was printed at Cambridge,
in 1649, by Samuel Green,&mdash;probably his first book,&mdash;and was entitled <i>A Platform
of Church Discipline</i>, etc. A copy of the printed volume was sent over to London by
John Cotton (who probably had the largest agency in preparing the work)<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> to Edward
Winslow, then in England, who procured it to be printed in 1653, with an explanatory
preface by himself.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>The important political union of the New England colonies, or a portion of them,
in 1643, has been already referred to. The Articles of Confederation were first printed
in 1656 in London, prefixed to Governor Eaton’s code of laws entitled <i>New Haven’s
Settling in New England</i>,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> to be mentioned further on.</p>

<p>The trouble of Massachusetts with Samuel Gorton was brought about by the unwarrantable
conduct of the colony towards that eccentric person. Gorton appealed to England,
and Edward Winslow, the diplomatist of Plymouth and Massachusetts, was sent
over to defend the Bay colony. Gorton’s <i>Simplicitie’s Defence</i>, published in London in
1646, was answered by Winslow’s <i>Hypocrasie Unmasked</i>, issued the same year. This
was reissued in 1649, with a new titlepage, called <i>The Danger of tolerating Levellers
in a Civill State</i>, the Dedication to the Earl of Warwick, in the former issue, being
omitted.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Winslow had his hands full, about this time, in defending Massachusetts. The
colony was never without a disturbing element in its own population, and about the time
of the trouble with Gorton a number of influential persons who held Presbyterian views
of church government were clamorous for the right of suffrage, which was denied them.
The controversy of the Government with Dr. Robert Child, Samuel Maverick, and others,
in 1646, need not be repeated here. An appeal was made to England. Child and some
of his associates went thither, and published a book in 1647, in London, called <i>New
England’s Jonas cast up at London</i>, edited by Child’s brother, Major John Child, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
name appears upon the titlepage. A postscript comments unfavorably on Winslow’s
<i>Hypocrasie Unmasked</i>. This book was replied to by Winslow in a tract called <i>New
England’s Salamander Discovered</i>, etc., London, 1647. These books are important as
illustrating Massachusetts history at this period.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>During this visit of Winslow to England, from which he never returned to New
England, he performed a grateful service in behalf of the natives. By his influence a
corporation was created by Parliament, in 1649, for propagating the gospel among the
Indian tribes in New England, and some of the accounts of the progress of the missions,
sent over from the colony, were published in London by the corporation. The conversion
of the natives was one object set forth in the Massachusetts charter; and Roger Williams
had, while a resident of Massachusetts and Plymouth, taken a deep interest in them, and
in 1643, while on a voyage to England, he drew up <i>A Key unto the Language of America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
published that year in London. In that same year there was also published in London
a small tract called <i>New England’s First-Fruits</i>, first in respect to the college, and
second in respect to the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Some hopeful instances of conversion among the
natives were briefly given in this tract. In 1647 a more full relation of Eliot’s labors was
sent over to Winslow, who the year before had arrived in England as agent of Massachusetts,
and printed under the title, <i>The Day breaking, if not the Sun rising, of the
Gospel with the Indians in New England</i>. In the following year, 1648, a narrative was
published in London, written by Thomas Shepard, called <i>The Clear Sunshine of the
Gospel breaking forth upon the Indians</i>,
etc., and this in 1649 was followed
by <i>The Glorious Progress of
the Gospel amongst the Indians in
New England</i>, setting forth the labors
of Eliot and Mayhew. The Rev.
Henry Whitfield, who had been pastor
of a church in Guilford, Conn., returned
to England in 1650; and in the following
year he published in London <i>The
Light appearing more and more towards
the Perfect Day</i>, and in 1652,
<i>Strength out of Weakness</i>, both containing
accounts, written chiefly by
Eliot, of the progress of his labors.
This last tract was the first of those published by the Corporation, which continued
thenceforth, for several years, to publish the record of the missions as they were sent
over from the colony. In 1653 a tract appeared under the title of <i>Tears of Repentance</i>,
etc.; in 1655, <i>A late and further Manifestation of the Progress of the Gospel</i>, etc.;
in 1659, <i>A further Accompt</i>, etc.; and in 1660, <i>A further Account</i> still.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Eliot’s literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
labors in behalf of the Massachusetts Indians culminated in the translation of the Bible
into their dialect, and its publication through the Cambridge press. The Testament was
printed in 1661, and the whole Bible in 1663; and second editions of each appeared,&mdash;the
former in 1680, and the latter in 1685.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>Eliot was imbued with the enthusiasm of the time. As John Cotton had deduced
a body of laws from the Scriptures, which he offered to the General Court for the colony,
so in like manner Eliot drew from the Scriptures a frame of government for a commonwealth.
It was entitled <i>The Christian Commonwealth; or, the Civil Polity of the Rising
Kingdom of Jesus Christ</i>, which he sent to England during the interregnum, and commended
to the people there. He had drawn up a similar form for his Indian community,
and had put it in practice. His manuscript, after slumbering for some years, was printed
in London in 1659, and some copies came over to the colony. The Restoration soon followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Eliot had in his treatise reflected on kingly government, and in May, 1661, the
General Court ordered the book to be totally suppressed; and all persons having copies
of it were commanded either to cancel or deface the same, or deliver them to the next
magistrate. Eliot acknowledged his fault under his own hand, saying he sent the manuscript
to England some nine or ten years before. Hutchinson, commenting on this whole
proceeding, says, “When the times change, men generally suffer their opinions to change
with them, so far at least as is necessary to avoid danger.” How many copies of the book
were destroyed by this order of the court, we cannot tell. A few years ago the only copy
known was owned by Colonel Thomas Aspinwall, then residing in London; and from this
copy a transcript was made, and it was printed in 1846 in 3 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, ix. 129.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Eliot was not the only distinguished citizen whose book came under the ban of the
Massachusetts authorities. William Pynchon, of Springfield, wrote a book which was
published in London in 1650, entitled <i>The Meritorious price of our Redemption</i>, etc.,
copies of which arrived in Boston during the session of the General Court in October of
that year. The Court immediately condemned it, and ordered it to be burned the next
day in the market-place, which was done; and Mr. Norton was asked to answer it.
Norton obeyed, and the book he wrote was ordered to be sent to London to be published.
It was <i>A Discussion of that Great Point in Divinity, the Sufferings of Christ</i>, etc., 1653.
Pynchon in the mean time was brought before the Court, and was plied by several orthodox
divines. He admitted that some points in his book were overstated, and his sentence
was postponed. Not liking his treatment here he went back to England in 1652, and
published a reply to Norton in a work with a title similar to that which gave the original
offence, London, 1655. Pynchon held that Christ did not suffer the torments of hell for
mankind, and that he bore not our sins by imputation. A more full answer to Norton’s
book was published by him in 1662, called the <i>Covenant of Nature</i>.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>John Winthrop died March 26, 1649. No man in the colony was so well qualified as
he, either from opportunity or character, to write its history. Yet he left no history. But
he left what was more precious,&mdash;a journal of events, recorded in chronological order,
from the time of his departure from England in the “Arbella,” to within two months of
his death. This Journal may be called the materials of history of the most valuable
character. The author himself calls it a “History of New England.” From this, for
the period which it covers, and from the records of the General Court for the same period,
a history of the colony for the first twenty years could be written. For over one hundred
years from Winthrop’s death no mention is made of his Journal. Although it was largely
drawn upon by Hubbard in his <i>History</i> (1680), and was used by Cotton Mather in his
<i>Magnalia</i>, it was cited by neither, and was first mentioned by Thomas Prince on the cover
of the first number of the second volume of his <i>Annals</i>, in 1755. Among his list of authorities
there given, he mentions “having lately received” this Journal of Governor Winthrop.
Prince made but little use of this manuscript, as the three numbers only which he
issued of his second volume ended with Aug. 5, 1633. Prince probably procured the
Journal from the Winthrop family in Connecticut. It was in three volumes. The first
and second volumes were restored to the family, and were published in Hartford in 1790,
in one volume, edited by Noah Webster.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> The third volume was found in the Prince
Library, in the tower of the Old South Church, in 1816, and was given to the Massachusetts
Historical Society. It was published, together with volumes one and two, in 1825
and 1826, in two volumes, edited by James Savage.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Volume two of the manuscript was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
destroyed by a fire which, Nov. 10, 1825, consumed the building in Court Street, Boston,
in which Mr. Savage had his office.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>The earliest published narrative&mdash;we can hardly call it a history&mdash;relating generally
to Massachusetts, is Edward Johnson’s “Wonder-Working
Providence of Sion’s Saviour in
New England,”&mdash;the running title to the book,
which on the titlepage is called a <i>History of New
England</i>, etc., London, 1654. The book does not profess to give an orderly account of
the settlement of New England, or even of Massachusetts, to which it wholly relates, but
describes what took place in the colony under his own observation largely, and what
would illustrate “the goodness of God in the settlement of these colonies.” The book is
supposed to have been written two or three years only before it was sent to England to be
published. It is conjectured that the titlepage was added by the publisher.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> The book

<p>The Quaker episode produced an abundant literature. Several Rhode Island Baptists
had previously received rough usage here; and Dr. John Clarke, one of the founders of
Rhode Island, who had a personal experience to relate, published in London, in 1652,&mdash;whither
he had gone with Roger Williams the year before,&mdash;a book against the colony,
called <i>Ill-Newes from New-England, or a Narrative of New-England’s Persecution</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>In 1654, two years before the Quakers made their appearance, the colony passed a law
against any one having in his possession the books of Reeve and Muggleton, “the two
Last Witnesses and True Prophets of Jesus Christ,” as they called themselves. Some of
the books of these fanatics had been printed in London in 1653, and had made their way
to the colony, and the executioner was ordered to burn all such books in the market-place
on the next Lecture day. In 1656 the Quakers came and brought their books, which
were at once seized and reserved for the fire; while sentence of banishment was passed
against those who brought them. The Quakers continued to flock to the colony in violation
of the law now passed against them. They were imprisoned, whipped, and two
were hanged in Boston in October, 1659, one in June, 1660, and one in March, 1661.
Some of the more important books which the Quaker controversy brought forth must
now be named. An account of the reception which the Quakers met with here soon
found its way to London, and to the hands of Francis Howgill, who published it with
the title, <i>The Popish Inquisition Newly Erected in New England</i>, etc., London, 1659.
Another tract appeared there the same year as <i>The Secret Works of a Cruel People
Made Manifest</i>. In the following year appeared <i>A Call from Death to Life</i>, letters
written “from the common goal of Boston” by Stephenson and Robinson (who were
shortly after executed); and one “written in Plymouth Prison” by Peter Pearson, a few
weeks later, giving an account of the execution of the two former.
In October, 1658, John Norton had been appointed by the Court
to write a treatise on the doctrines of the Quakers, which he did,
and the tract was printed in Cambridge in 1659, and in London in 1660, with the title,
<i>The Heart of New England Rent at the Blasphemies of the Present Generation</i>. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
three Quakers had been hanged, the colony, under date of Dec. 19, 1660, sent an “Humble
Petition and Address of the General Court ... unto the High and Mighty Prince
Charles the Second,” defending their conduct.
This was presented February 11, and printed, and
was replied to by Edward Burroughs in an elaborate
volume, which contains a full account of the
first three martyrs. This was followed this year,
1661, by a yet more important volume, by George Bishope, called <i>New England Judged</i>,
in which the story of the Quaker persecution from the beginning is told. Bishope lived in
England, and published in a first volume the accounts and letters of the sufferers sent
over to him. A second volume was published in 1667, continuing the narrative of the
sufferings and of the hanging of William Leddra, in March, 1661. A general <i>History of
the Quakers</i> was written by William Sewel, a Dutch Quaker of Amsterdam, published
there in his native tongue, in 1717, folio. Sewel’s grandfather was an English Brownist,
who emigrated to Holland. The book was translated by the author himself into English,
and published in London in 1722.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Joseph Besse’s book,&mdash;<i>A Collection of the Sufferings
of the People called Quakers, for the Testimony of a Good Conscience</i>, 1753,&mdash;contains
a mass of most valuable statistics about the Quakers. Hutchinson’s <i>History of Massachusetts
Bay</i> has an excellent summarized account, as do the histories of Dr. Palfrey and
Mr. Barry.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>The records of the colony, as I have frequently had occasion to observe, afford the
richest materials for the colony’s history, and never more so than in regard to the trials
which the colony experienced from the period following the Restoration to the time of Dudley
and Andros. The story of the visit of the royal commissioners here in 1665 is no
where so fully told as there. Indeed, the principal source of the history of Maine and of
New Hampshire while they were for many years a component part of the colony of Massachusetts
is told in the records of the old Bay State.</p>

<p>During the trouble with the Quakers Massachusetts was afflicted by a wordy controversy,
imported from Connecticut, but which did not reach its culminating point till
1662. I refer to the “Half-way Covenant,” for the discussion of which a council of
ministers from both colonies was called in 1657, in Boston, which pronounced in favor of
the system in question. A synod of Massachusetts churches in 1662 confirmed the
judgment here given, and the Half-way Covenant system prevailed extensively in New
England for more than a century. After the synod was dissolved, and the result was published
by order of the General Court, the discussion continued, and several tracts were
issued from the Cambridge press, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, in 1662, 1663, and 1664.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Of Morton’s <i>New
England’s Memorial</i> mention has already been made in the preceding chapter, as it concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
chiefly the Plymouth Colony. It contains, however, many things of interest about
Massachusetts; recording the death of many of her worthies, and embalming their memories
in verse. It ends with the year 1668, with a notice of the death of Jonathan Mitchel,
the minister of Cambridge, and of that of John Eliot, Jr., the son of the apostle, at the age
of thirty-two years. There are five unpaged leaves after “finis,” containing “A Brief
Chronological Table.”</p>

<p>There was printed in London in 1674 <i>An Account of Two Voyages to New England</i>, by
John Josselyn, Gent., a duodecimo volume of 279 pages. This author and traveller was a
brother of Henry Josselyn, of Black Point, or Scarborough, in Maine, and they are said to
have been sons of Sir Thomas Josselyn, of Kent, knight. John came to New England in
1638, and landed at Noddle’s Island, and was a guest of Samuel Maverick; thence he
went to Scarborough, stayed with his brother till the end of 1639, and then returned home.
In 1663 he came over again, and stayed till 1671; and then went home and wrote this
book. His own observations are valuable, but his history is often erroneous. He frequently
cites Johnson. At the end of his book is a chronological table running back
before the Christian era. His <i>New England’s Rarities</i>, published in 1672, giving an account
of the fauna and flora of the country, has been reprinted with notes in the American
Antiquarian Society’s <i>Transactions</i>, vol. iv., edited by Edward Tuckerman.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>The interest of John Ogilby’s large folio on <i>America</i> is almost solely a borrowed one,
so far as concerns New England history, arising from the use he made of Wood, Johnson,
and Gorges.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>The modern student will find a very interesting series of successive bulletins, as it
were, of the sensations engendered by the progress of the Indian outbreak of 1675-76,
known as “Philip’s War,” and of the events as they occurred, in a number of tracts, mostly
of few pages, which one or more persons in Boston sent to London to be printed. They
are now among the choicest rarities of a New England library.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> It was to make an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>

Hubbard’s <i>Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians</i>, which likewise came from the
London press the same year with a changed title, <i>The Present State of New England,
being a Narrative</i>, etc.,&mdash;a book not, however, confined to Philip’s War, but going back,
as the Boston title better showed, over the whole series of the conflicts with the natives.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1679 it became known to the members of the General Court that the Rev.
William Hubbard, of Ipswich, had compiled a <i>History of New England</i>, and in June of
that year they ordered that the Governor and four
other persons be a committee “to peruse the same,”
and make return of their opinion thereof by the next
session, in order “that the Court may then, as they
shall then judge meet, take order for the impression thereof.” Two years afterward, in
October, the Court thankfully acknowledged the services of Mr. Hubbard in compiling
his <i>History</i>, and voted him fifty pounds in money, “he transcribing it fairly into a book
that it may be the more easily perused.” There was no further movement made for
the printing of the volume. The transcript made agreeably to this order is now in the
Library of the Massachusetts Historical Society. The preface and some leaves of the
text are wanting. This was by far the most important history of New England which
had then been written. The compiler had the benefit of Bradford’s <i>History</i> and Winthrop’s
Journal, though, after the fashion of the time, he makes no mention of them, only
acknowledging in a general way his indebtedness to “the original manuscripts of such as
had the managing of those affairs under their hands.” The manuscript was first printed
in 1815 by the Massachusetts Historical Society; and a second edition, “collated with the
original MS.,” was printed in 1848.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>The history of the struggles of the colony to maintain its charter during the period
immediately preceding the loss of it is largely told in the pages of its records, and in a
large mass of documents published in Hutchinson’s volume of Papers, and cited in Chalmers’
<i>Annals</i> and in Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>. Reference may also be made to a paper
by the present writer in vol. i. of <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, on this struggle to maintain
the charter.</p>

<p>The history of the Dudley and Andros administrations may be gathered from numerous
publications which came from the press just after the Revolution; and, without
mentioning their titles, I cannot do better than refer to them as published in three volumes
by the Prince Society of Boston, called the <i>Andros Tracts</i>, edited with abundant
notes by William H. Whitmore.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Palfrey’s <i>History</i> should be read in connection with
these memorials. The original papers of the “Inter-charter Period” are largely wanting,
though some volumes of the Massachusetts Archives are so entitled.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>As materials for the history of the State it should be remembered that there are many
town histories which contain matter of more than mere local interest. The history of the
town of Boston is in a great degree the history of the colony and State, and the several
histories of that town, notably those by Caleb H. Snow (to 1825) and Samuel G. Drake
(to 1770), and the <i>Description</i> of N. B. Shurtleff,<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> may be specially mentioned; while the
recently published <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, edited by Mr. Justin Winsor, is indispensable
to any student who wishes to know a large part of the story of Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
The <i>History of Salem</i>, by Dr. J. B. Felt, gives many documents of the first importance
relating to the settlement of that ancient town, where the colony had its birth; and the
same writer’s <i>Customs of New England</i>, Boston, 1853, has a distinctive value.</p>

<p>The <i>Bibliography of the Local History of Massachusetts</i>, by Jeremiah Colburn, Boston,
1871, a volume of 119 pages, deserves a place in every New England library,<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> and it may
be supplemented by the brief titles included in Mr. F. B. Perkins’s <i>Check List of American
History</i>.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> There is a good list of local histories in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 1,558,
etc. The <i>Sketches of the Judicial History of Massachusetts</i>, by the late Emory Washburn,
is a most important book for that phase of the subject.</p>

Ferdinando Gorges. The previous operations under the Laconia Company were partly,
as we have seen, on the territory of Maine, while in part also their history is preserved in
the archives of New Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>The patent issued to Gorges at the general division, in 1635, of the territory which
he named “New Somersetshire,” is not extant. An organization, as we have already
said, took place under this grant, and a few records are extant in manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>The royal charter of Maine, dated April 3, 1639, was transcribed into a book of records
of the Court of Common Pleas and Sessions for the county of York, and, with the commissions
to the officers, has been printed by Sullivan in his <i>History of Maine</i>, Boston,
1795, Appendix No. 1.</p>


<p>The first government organized under the charter<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> was in 1640, and the manuscript
records are also at Alfred with the commissions to the officers. Extracts from the records
were made by Folsom, as above, pp. 53-57. After the submission of Maine to Massachusetts
in 1653, courts were held at York under the authority of the latter. Afterward,
when the royal commissioners came over and went into Maine, a portion of the inhabitants
were encouraged to rebel against the authority of Massachusetts, and courts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>

<p class="p2">Of general histories of Maine, the
earliest was that of James Sullivan, entitled
<i>The History of the District of Maine</i>,
Boston, 1795, the territory having been
made a Federal district in 1779. Judge
Sullivan was too busy a man to write so
complicated a history as that of Maine;
and he fell into some errors, and came
short of what would be expected of a
writer at the present day. He was one
of the founders and at that time president
of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
and doubtless felt the obligation to do
some such work. The next important <i>History of Maine</i> is that of Judge William D.
Williamson, published at Hallowell, 1832, in two volumes. This contains a vast amount
of material indispensable to the student; but there are serious errors in the work, made
known by the discovery of new matter since its publication. In 1830 there was published
at Saco, Maine, a small 12º volume, by George Folsom,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> called <i>History of Saco and Biddeford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
with Notices of other Early Settlements</i>, etc. Although a history of two comparatively
small towns, now cities, yet they were early settlements; and the author, who had
a faculty for history, made his work the occasion of writing a brief but authentic sketch of
the history of Maine under all her multiform governments and varying fortunes. It was
the best town history then written in New England, as it was also the best history of the
Province of Maine..</p>

<p>I might mention a volume of <i>Sketches of the Ecclesiastical History of Maine from the
Earliest Period</i>, by the Rev. Jonathan Greenleaf of Wells, published at Portsmouth, 1821.</p>

<p>In 1831-33 William Willis published his <i>History of Portland</i>, in two parts. The work
embraced also sketches of several other towns, and it was prefaced by an account of the
early patents and settlements in Maine; while the second edition, issued in 1865, is yet
more full on the general history of the province.</p>

<p>There are other valuable town histories, and I cannot do better than refer the reader
to Mr. William Willis’s “Descriptive Catalogue of Books relating to Maine,” in <i>Norton’s
Literary Letter</i>, No. 4, for 1859, and as enlarged in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, March, 1870.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

amount of material which illustrates this early period. The first volume was issued
in 1831, and in fact forms the first part of Willis’s <i>History of Portland</i>. The <i>Collections</i>
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and especially vol. vii. of the fourth series,
should be cited as of special interest here.</p>

<p>The <i>Relation</i> of the Council for New England, the narratives in Purchas, Winthrop’s
Journal, Hubbard’s <i>Indian Wars</i>, and that author’s <i>History of New England</i> and the
<i>Two Voyages</i> of Josselyn, have already been referred to, and they should be again noted in
this place, as should Dr. Palfrey’s <i>History of New England</i> especially. Gorges’ <i>Briefe
Narration</i>, 1658, is most valuable as coming from the original proprietor himself. Its value
is seriously impaired by its want of chronological order and of dates, and by its errors in
date. In what condition the manuscript was left by its author, and to what extent the
blemishes of the work are attributable to the editor or the printer, can never be known.
Sir Ferdinando died in May, 1647. The work was written not long before his death, and
was published some twelve years afterward, with two compilations by his grandson and the
sheets of Johnson’s <i>Wonder-Working Providence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Notwithstanding its blemishes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
tract has great value; but it should be read in connection with other works which furnish
unquestionable historical data.</p>

<p>The <i>Memorial Volume of the Popham Celebration</i>, Aug. 20, 1862 (Portland, 1862),
contains a good deal of historical material; but a large part of it was, unfortunately, prepared
under a strong theological and partisan bias. In its connection with the settlement
at Sabino, it has been mentioned in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>A valuable historical address was delivered at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia,
Nov. 4, 1876, by Joshua L. Chamberlain, President of Bowdoin College, entitled
<i>Maine, Her Place in History</i>, and was published in Augusta in 1877.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">New Hampshire.</span>&mdash;New Hampshire was probably first settled by David Thomson,
in the spring of 1623. The original sources of information concerning him are the
<i>Records</i> of the Council for New England; a contemporaneous indenture, 1622, recently
found among the Winthrop Papers, and since published; Winslow’s <i>Good News</i>, London,
1624, p. 50; Bradford’s <i>Plymouth Plantation</i>, p. 154; Hubbard’s <i>New England</i>, pp. 89,
105, 214, 215; Levett’s Voyage<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> to New England in 1623/24; Pratt’s Narrative, in 4 <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, iv. 486, and Gorges’ <i>Briefe Narration</i>, p. 37. All these authorities are summarized
by the present writer in a note, on page 362 of <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, May,
1876, to a paper on “David Thomson and the Settlement of New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>For the settlement of the Hiltons on Dover Neck, and for the later history of the
town, see <i>Records</i> of the Council; Hubbard; a Paper on David Thomson in <i>Mass. Hist.

deed, it will be sufficient, perhaps, to refer to Mr. Savage’s argument against it in
Winthrop’s Journal, i. Appendix, which the present writer thinks unanswerable, and
Governor C. H. Bell’s able defence of it in the volume of the Prince Society on John
Wheelwright.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the several patents issued by the Council to cover the territory of New
Hampshire, or parts of it, which afterward appeared in history, one was made to John
Mason, of Nov. 7, 1629, of territory between the Merrimac and Piscataqua, which, “with
consent of the Council, he intends to name New Hampshire” (Mason was governor of
Portsmouth co. Hants). This grant<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> was printed in Hazard, vol. i., from “New Hampshire
files,” and is in <i>Provincial Papers</i>, i. 21. The Laconia grant of Nov. 17, 1629, to
Gorges and Mason, was the basis of a trading company, as we have already seen, and
those associates took out a new patent, Nov. 3, 1631, of land near the mouth of the
Piscataqua. The Laconia patent is in Massachusetts Archives, and is printed in <i>Provincial
Papers</i>, i. 38. The second grant is printed in Jenness’s <i>Notes</i>, above cited,
Appendix ii. Hilton’s patent of Dover Neck, or wherever it may have extended, of March
12, 1629/30, is cited in the Council <i>Records</i>, and is printed <i>in extenso</i> in Jenness’s <i>Notes</i>,
Appendix i., which also should be read for a discussion relative to its boundaries.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> At the
grand division in 1635 Mason had assigned to him the territory between Naumkeag and
Piscataqua, dated April 22, “all which lands, with the consent of the Counsell, shall from
henceforth be called New Hampshire.” Hazard (i. 384) printed the grant from the “records
of the Province of Maine,” and it is also printed in <i>Provincial Papers</i>, i. 33. Mason never
improved this grant. All his operations in New Hampshire, or Piscataqua, as the place
was called, was as a member of the unfortunate Laconia Company. He died soon after
this last grant was issued, and bequeathed the property ultimately to his grandchildren
John and Robert Tufton, whose claims were used to annoy the settlers on the soil who had
acquired a right to their homesteads by long undisputed possession.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>After the union of the New Hampshire towns with Massachusetts, their history forms
part of the history of that colony, and the <i>General Court Records</i> may be consulted for
information. John S. Jenness’s <i>Transcripts of Original Documents in the English
Archives relating to New Hampshire</i>, privately printed, New York, 1876, is a volume of
great value. An early map of Maine and New Hampshire, of about the period of 1655, is
prefixed to the book. The Appendix to Belknap’s <i>New Hampshire</i> also contains documents
of great value. The <i>Collections</i> of the New Hampshire Historical Society, consisting
of eight volumes, 1824-1866, are rich in material relating to the State; and the three
volumes of <i>Collections</i> published by Farmer and Moore,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> 1822-1824, in semi-monthly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
then in monthly numbers, should not be overlooked; nor should the <i>Collections</i> of the
Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>

<p>Of the general histories, that of Dr. Belknap is the first and the only considerable <i>History
of New Hampshire</i>, Philadelphia and Boston, 1784-92, 3 vols. The work early acquired
the name of “the elegant History of New Hampshire,” which it deserved. As a writer, Dr.
Belknap’s style was simple and “elegant.” Perhaps after Franklin he was the best writer
of English prose which New England had produced; and there has been since little improvement
upon him. He had the true historical spirit, and was a good investigator.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> He
fell into an error respecting some of the early grants of New Hampshire, and the early part
of his History needs revision. He probably never doubted the genuineness of the Wheelwright
deed; but John Farmer, the editor of a new edition (1831) of his work, believed that
document to be a forgery, and made his book to conform to this idea, though other errors
were not corrected. Palfrey’s <i>New England</i> is of the first authority here after Belknap.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Connecticut</span>.&mdash;“<i>Quinni-tuk-ut</i>, ‘on long river,’&mdash;now <i>Connecticut</i>,&mdash;was the name

<p><i>Quinnipiac</i>,&mdash;the Indian name of New Haven, written variously, and by President
Stiles, on the authority of an Indian of East Haven, <i>Quinnepyooghq</i>,&mdash;is probably “longwater

<p>The first English settlement was made by the Plymouth people at Windsor in October,
1633, when they sent out a barque with materials for a trading-house, and set it up there
against the remonstrances of the Dutch, who had themselves established a trading-house
at Hartford some time before.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The history of this business is well told by Bradford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
(pp. 311-314), with whose narrative compare Winthrop (pp. 105, 181) and Hubbard
(pp. 170, 305 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>The story of the settlement of the three towns on the Connecticut River by emigrants
from Massachusetts is told by Winthrop, <i>passim</i>, and by Trumbull; and the <i>Records</i> of
Massachusetts show the orders passed in relation to their removal, and define their political
status during the first year of the settlement, and indeed to a later period. The Connecticut
<i>Colonial Records</i> give abundant information as to their political relations until the
arrival of the Winthrop charter of 1662, when, after some demurring on the part of New
Haven, the two small jurisdictions were merged into one.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> A spirited letter from Mr.
Hooker to Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, written in 1638, disclosing his suppressed
feelings towards some in the Bay Colony for alleged factious opposition to the
emigration to Connecticut, may be seen in <i>Conn. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. 3-18. What is called
the original Constitution of Connecticut, adopted by the three towns Jan. 14, 1638/39, may
be seen in the printed <i>Colonial Records</i>, i. 20-25.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>The story of John Winthrop’s second arrival from England, in October, 1635, with a
commission from Lord Say and Sele, and Lord Brook and others, and with £2,000 in
money, to begin an independent settlement and erect a fortification near the mouth of the
Connecticut River, and to be governor there for one year, is told in Winthrop’s Journal
(i. 170, 173); and is repeated in full by Trumbull, vol. i. Possession was taken in the
following month. The patent to Lord Say and others, which was the basis of this movement,
is known as the “old patent of Connecticut,” and may be seen, with Winthrop’s
commission, in Trumbull’s <i>History</i>, vol. i., both editions. It purports to be a personal
grant from the Earl of Warwick, then the President of the Council for New England,
bearing date March 19, 1631 (1632 N.S.). Although the authority by which the grant is
made is not given in the document itself, as is usually the case, it has been confidently
asserted that the Earl of Warwick had received the previous year a patent for the same
territory from the Council for New England, which was subsequently confirmed by the
King.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> The grant was interpreted to convey all the territory lying west of the Narragansett
River, one hundred and twenty miles on the Sound, thence onward to the South
Sea.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>The “Capital Laws,” established by Connecticut, Dec. 1, 1642, the first “Code of
Laws,” and the court orders, judgments, and sentences of the General and Particular
Courts, from 1636 to 1662, are printed in <i>Connecticut Colonial Records</i>.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>The contemporaneous accounts of the Pequot War have already been mentioned
under “Massachusetts.” What relates specially to Connecticut is largely told in the
<i>Colonial Records</i>. Mason’s narrative is by far the best of the original accounts which have
been published. The dispute with Massachusetts respecting the division of the conquered
territory; the allotments of the same to the soldiers; the account of the younger Winthrop’s
settlement in the Pequot country, and his claim to the Nehantick country by an
early gift of Sashions, not allowed by the United Colonies,&mdash;may be seen in the records
of Massachusetts and Connecticut, and in the records of the United Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>The account of the settlement of New Haven by emigrants from Massachusetts&mdash;indirectly
from the city of London,&mdash;in 1638; of their purchases of lands from the
natives, and of the formation of their government,&mdash;church and civil,&mdash;may be seen in
Winthrop,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> and in <i>New Haven Colonial Records</i>.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>The Fundamental Articles, or Original Constitution, of the Colony of New Haven,
June 4, 1639, which continued in force till 1665, was printed in Trumbull’s <i>History</i>, vol. i.,
in 1797, in Appendix, no. iv., as also in the later edition, and in the <i>Colonial Records</i>,
i. 11-17, in which volume the legislative and judicial history of the colony is recorded
for many years. The orders of the General Court, the civil and criminal trials before
the Court of Magistrates, with the evidence spread out on the pages of the record, and
the sentences following, being, in criminal cases, based on the Laws of Moses, furnish an
unpleasant exhibition; perhaps not more so, however, than other primitive colonies would
have shown if their record of crimes had been as well preserved. From April, 1644, to
May, 1653, the <i>Records</i> of New Haven jurisdiction are lost.</p>

<p>What is known as Governor Eaton’s<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Code of Laws was sent to London to be printed
under the supervision of Governor Hopkins, who had returned to England a few years
before; and an edition of five hundred copies appeared in 1656, under the title of <i>New
Haven’s Settling in New England</i>, etc. The code was first reprinted by Mr. Royal R.
Hinman, at Hartford, in 1838, in a volume entitled <i>The Blue Laws of New Haven Colony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
usually called Blue Laws of Connecticut, Quaker Laws of Plymouth and Massachusetts</i>,
etc.; and again, in 1858, at the end of the second volume of <i>New Haven Records</i>, from a
rare copy in the Library of the American Antiquarian Society.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The “Articles of Confederation”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of the United Colonies of 1643, whose records are a mine of history in themselves,
were prefixed to this code, and were here printed for the first time. The <i>Records</i>
were first printed by Hazard in 1794, from the Plymouth copy, and they have more recently
been reprinted by the State of Massachusetts in a volume of the <i>Plymouth Records</i>.
Each colony had a copy of those records, but the only ones preserved are those of Plymouth
and of Connecticut. The latter, containing some entries wanting in the former, are
printed at the end of vol. iii. of the <i>Connecticut Colonial Records</i>.</p>

<p>The Quakers gave little disturbance to either of these colonies. While the people
in Connecticut were divided with the “Half-Way Covenant” controversy, the Quakers,
in July, 1656, made their appearance in Boston. The United Colonies recommended the
several jurisdictions to pass laws prohibiting their coming, and banishing those who
should come. Connecticut and New Haven took the alarm, and acted upon the advice
given. New Haven subsequently increased the penalties at first prescribed, yet falling
short in severity of the legislation of Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>The territorial disputes of Connecticut and New Haven with the Dutch at Manhados,
which began early and were of long continuance, find abundant illustration in
Trumbull’s <i>History of Connecticut</i>, and in Brodhead’s <i>History of New York</i>, and in the
documentary history, of which the materials were procured by Brodhead, but arranged by
O’Callaghan.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>The records of the two colonies show the ample provision made for public schools,
and indicate a project entertained by New Haven as early as 1648 to found a college,&mdash;a
scheme not consummated, however, till a later period.</p>

<p>The Winthrop charter of 1662, which united the two colonies, is in Hazard, ii. 597,
taken from a printed volume of <i>Charters</i>, London, 1766. It had been printed at New
London in 1750, in a volume of <i>Acts and Laws</i>, and is in a volume by Samuel Lucas,
London, 1850. The charter bears date April 23, 1662. In an almanac of John Winthrop,
the younger, for the year 1662, once temporarily in my possession, and now belonging to
the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, I noticed this manuscript note of the former owner, which
I copied: “This day, May 10, in the afternoon, the Patent for Connecticut was sealed.”
The orders, instructions, and correspondence relating to the procuring of this charter
are printed in the <i>Colonial Records</i>, text and Appendix, and in Trumbull, vol. i., text
and Appendix.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The Restoration brought its anxieties as well as its blessings. The story of the
shelter afforded to the regicides Whalley and Goffe, by New Haven, is an interesting
episode. Dr. Stiles’s volume, <i>A History of
the Three Judges</i> [including Colonel Dixwell]
<i>of King Charles I.</i>, etc. (Hartford, 1794), is a
minute collection of facts, though not always
carefully weighed and analyzed.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>The granting of the royal charter of 1662,
which was followed next year by that to
Rhode Island, brought on the long controversy
with that colony as to the eastern boundary
of Connecticut; and the revival of the
claim of the heirs of the Duke of Hamilton&mdash;a
claim more easily disposed of&mdash;added to
the annoyances. The papers relating to these
controversies may be seen in the <i>Colonial Records</i>
of Connecticut, ii. 526-554, and of Rhode
Island, ii. 70-75, 128.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>After the union, the earliest printed <i>Book
of General Laws for the People within the
Jurisdiction of Connecticut</i> was in 1673,&mdash;the
code established the year before. It was
printed at Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>The authorities for the history of Philip’s
War&mdash;so disastrous to Massachusetts, Plymouth,
and Rhode Island, but from which
“Connecticut,” says Trumbull, “had suffered
nothing in comparison with her sister colonies”&mdash;have
already been given under the
head of “Massachusetts.” Without citing
special documents, it may be said that Trumbull’s
<i>History of Connecticut</i> and Palfrey’s <i>New England</i> furnish abundant authority
from this time down to the conclusion of the government of New England under Andros,
and the narrative of each may be referred to as fitting, ample, and trustworthy. Trumbull’s
<i>History</i>, as an original authority, may well compare for Connecticut with Hutchinson’s
<i>History</i> for Massachusetts. The first volume (1630-1713) was published in 1797; and,
although the titlepage to it reads “Vol. I.,” the author says in the Preface to vol. ii.,
first printed in 1818 (1713-1764), that he never had any design of publishing another
volume. The first volume was reprinted in 1818 as a companion to vol. ii.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Records</i> of Connecticut for the period embraced in this chapter are abundant, and
are admirably edited, with explanatory notes, by Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hartford,
who has done so much to illustrate the history of his State, and indeed of New England.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
I might add that Dr. Palfrey, in writing the <i>History of New England</i>, often had the
benefit of Dr. Trumbull’s learning in illustrating many obscure points in Connecticut
history.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>The <i>New Haven Colony Records</i> end, of course, with the absorption of that colony
by Connecticut. These are well edited, in two volumes (1638 to 1649, and 1653 to 1665),
with abundant illustrations in the Appendix, by Charles J. Hoadly, M.A., and were published
at Hartford in 1857-58.</p>

<p>The <i>Collections</i> of the Connecticut Historical Society have already been referred to.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>The New Haven Colony Historical Society is a separate body, devoted to preserving
the memorials of that colony. It has issued three volumes of <i>Papers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>Among the general histories of Connecticut was one by Theodore Dwight, Jr., in
Harper’s Family Library, 1840; also another by G. H. Hollister, 2 vols., 1855, and
enlarged in 1857. A condensed <i>History of the Colony of New Haven, before and
after the Union</i>, by E. R. Lambert, was published at New Haven in 1838; and a
more extensive <i>History of the Colony of New Haven to its Absorption into Connecticut</i>,
by E. E. Atwater, was published in New Haven in 1881.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> There are some
town histories which, for the early period, have almost the character of histories of
the State,&mdash;like Caulkins’s <i>Norwich</i> (originally 1845; enlarged 1866, and again in
1874) and <i>New London</i> (1852); Orcutt and Beadsley’s <i>Derby</i> (1642-1880); William
Cothren’s <i>Ancient Woodbury</i>, 3 vols., published in 1854-79; H. R. Stiles’s <i>Ancient
Windsor</i>, 2 vols., 1859-63. Barber’s <i>Connecticut Historical Collections</i> is a convenient

Providence Plantations was an <i>Historical Discourse</i>, delivered at Newport in 1738, on the
centennial of the settlement of Aquedneck, by John Callender, minister of that place, and
printed at Boston the next year.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>Twenty-seven years afterward,&mdash;that is, in 1765,&mdash;there appeared in seven numbers
of a newspaper (the <i>Providence Gazette</i>), from January 12 to March 30, “An Historical
Account of the Planting and Growth of Providence.” This sketch, written by the venerable
Stephen Hopkins, then governor of the State, interrupted by the disastrous occurrences
of the times, comes down only to 1645, and remains a fragment.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p><i>A Gazeteer of the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island</i>, with maps of each State,
was published at Hartford in 1819, in 8º, compiled by John C. Pease and John M. Niles.
It furnished for the time a large amount of statistical and historical material. The work
gives a geographical sketch of each county, with details of each town, and “embraces
notices of population, business, etc., together with biographical sketches of eminent men.”</p>

<p>“Memoirs of Rhode Island” were written by the late Henry Bull, of Newport, in
1832, and published in the <i>Rhode Island Republican</i> (newspaper) of that year.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> <i>A Discourse
embracing the Civil and Religious History of Rhode Island, delivered at Newport</i>,
April 4, 1838, by Arthur A. Ross, pastor of a Baptist church at Newport, was published
at Providence in the same year, and is full on the history of Newport.</p>

<p>In 1853 there was published in New York an octavo volume of 370 pages, entitled
<i>History of Rhode Island</i>, by the Rev. Edward Peterson. “This book abounds in errors,
and is of no historical value. It is not a continuous history, but is made up of scraps,
without chronological arrangement.”<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>In 1859 and 1860 was published the <i>History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations</i>, by Samuel Greene Arnold, in two volumes,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>&mdash;a work honorable alike
to its author and to the State. While Mr. Arnold was writing this history, Dr. Palfrey
was engaged upon his masterly <i>History of New England</i>. These writers differed somewhat
in their interpretation of historical events and in their estimate of historical
personages, and the student of New England history should read them both. The
value of these works consists not only in the text or narrative parts, but also in the notes,
which for the student, particularly in Dr. Palfrey’s book, contain valuable information, in
a small compass, upon the authorities on which the narrative rests.</p>

<p>The late George Washington Greene prepared <i>A Short History of Rhode Island</i>, published
in 1877, in 348 pages, which formed an excellent compendium, much needed. It is
compiled largely from Mr. Arnold’s work.</p>

<p>“The Early History of Narragansett,” by Elisha R. Potter, was published as vol. iii.
of the <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, in 1835. It is a valuable collection of events, arranged in
chronological order, and illustrated by original documents in an appendix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Annals of the Town of Providence from its First Settlement,” etc., to the year
1832, by William R. Staples, was published, in 1834, as vol. v. of the <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>
The author says that the work does not assume to be a “history;” but it is a valuable
and authentic record of events from the time of Roger Williams’s settlement on the banks
of the Mooshausic, in 1636, to the year 1832, illustrated by original documents, the whole
making 670 pages.</p>

<p>I ought not to omit the mention of several addresses and discourses delivered before
the Rhode Island Historical Society, some of which have considerable historical interest, as
illustrating the principles on which it is claimed that Rhode Island was founded. Special
mention may be made of the Discourse of Judge Pitman, that of Chief Justice Durfee,
and that of the late Zachariah Allen.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>As Roger Williams is properly held to be the founder of the State of Rhode Island;
and as many of his writings had become quite rare, a society was formed in 1865, called
the “Narragansett Club,” for the purpose of republishing all his known writings. Vol. i.,
containing Williams’s <i>Key to the Indian Languages of America</i>, edited by Dr. J. Hammond
Trumbull,<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> was issued in 1866; and vol. vi., the concluding volume, in which are
collected all the known letters of Williams, in 1874. The volumes were published in
quarto form, in antique style, and edited by well-known historical scholars, and are a
valuable contribution to the personal history of Roger Williams and to the history of
the controversy on religious liberty, of which he was the great advocate.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>The earliest publication of any of Williams’s letters was by Isaac Backus, in his
<i>History of New England</i>, etc., 1777, 1784, 1796, in three volumes, written with particular
reference to the Baptists. It treats largely of Rhode Island history, and is a most
authentic work.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>A series of <i>Rhode Island Historical Tracts</i>, beginning in 1878, has been issued by
Sidney S. Rider, of Providence, each being a monograph on some subject of Rhode
Island history. No. 4, on <i>William Coddington in Rhode Island Colonial Affairs</i>, is an
unfavorable criticism on the conduct of Coddington in the episode known as “the Usurpation,”
by Dr. Henry E. Turner.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> No. 15, issued in 1882, is a tract of 267 pages, on
<i>The Planting and Growth of Providence</i>, by Henry C. Dorr. It is a valuable monograph,
and would have been more valuable if authorities had been more freely cited.</p>

<p>One valuable source of the history of Rhode Island is the <i>Records</i> of the colony, and
these have been made available for use by publication, under the efficient editorship of the
Hon. John Russell Bartlett, for a number of years Secretary of State. To make up
for the meagreness of the records in some places, the editor has introduced from exterior
sources many official papers, which make good the deficiencies and abundantly illustrate
the history of the times. The first volume was issued in 1856, and begins with the “Records
of the Settlements at Providence, Portsmouth, Newport, and Warwick, from their
commencement to their union under the Colony Charter, 1636 to 1647.”</p>

<p>The early history of Providence is so intimately interwoven with the life of its founder,
that some of the excellent memoirs of Roger Williams may be read with profit as historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
works. A <i>Memoir of Williams</i>, by Professor James D. Knowles, was published in
1834, and is a minute and conscientious biography of the man; but it is written with
a strong bias in favor of Williams where he comes in collision with the authorities of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>A very pleasant memoir of Williams, by Professor William Gammell, based on that
of Knowles, was published in 1845, in Sparks’s <i>American Biography</i>, reissued the next
year in a volume by itself. This memoir was followed in 1852 by <i>A Life of Roger
Williams</i>, by Professor Romeo Elton, published in England, where the author then
lived, and in Providence the next year. This is largely based on Knowles’s memoir,
but contains some new matter, notably the Sadlier Correspondence.</p>

<p>The original authorities for Williams’s career in Massachusetts and Plymouth are
Winthrop and Bradford and the controversial tracts of Cotton and Williams, from which
bits of history may be culled. For a full presentation and discussion of the facts and
principles involved in Williams’s banishment from Massachusetts, and his alleged offence
to the authorities there, see the late Professor Diman’s Editorial Preface to Cotton’s
<i>Reply to Williams</i>, in the second volume of the Narragansett Club, above cited; Dr.
George E. Ellis’s Lecture on “The Treatment of Intruders and Dissentients by the
Founders of Massachusetts,” in <i>Lowell Lectures</i>, Boston, Jan. 12, 1869; Dr. Henry
Martyn Dexter’s <i>As to Roger Williams</i>, etc., Boston, 1876;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, for

<p>In Dr. John Clarke’s <i>Ill News from New England</i>, London, 1653,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> being a personal
narrative of the treatment, the year before, by the authorities of the Bay Colony, of Obadiah
Holmes, John Crandall, and John Clarke, and an account of the laws and ecclesiastical
polity of that colony, is a brief account of the settlement of Providence and of
the island of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>An important episode in the early history of Rhode Island was the career of Samuel
Gorton, who settled the town of Warwick. I have already mentioned, under the head
of Massachusetts, the original books in which the story for and against him is told,&mdash;<i>Simplicitie’s
Defence</i>, written by Gorton, and <i>Hypocracie Unmasked</i>, by Edward Winslow.
The former was republished in the <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. ii., in 1835, edited by W. R.
Staples, with a preface, notes, and appendix of original papers. Winslow’s book, now
very rare, has never been reprinted. A “Life of Samuel Gorton,” by John M. Mackie,
was published in 1845 in Sparks’s <i>American Biography</i>. After Nathaniel Morton published
his <i>New England’s Memorial</i>, in 1669, containing some reflections on Gorton, the
latter wrote a letter to Morton, dated “Warwick, June 30, 1669,” in his own defence.
Hutchinson had the letter, and printed an abridgment of it in the Appendix to his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
volume. Some forty years ago or less, the original letter came into the possession of the
late Edward A. Crowninshield, of Boston, and he allowed Peter Force to print it, and it
appears entire in vol. iv. of Force’s <i>Historical Tracts</i>, 1846.</p>

<p>The early settlers of Rhode Island had no patent-claim to lands on which they planted.
The consent of the natives only was obtained. Williams’s deed, so called, from the
Indians, may be seen in vols. iv. and v. <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>; and that to Coddington and
his friends, of Aquedneck, is also in the Appendix to vol. iv. The parchment charter
which Williams obtained from the Parliamentary Commissioners, dated March 14, 1643, is
lost, but it had been copied several times, and is printed in vols. ii., iii., and iv., <i>R. I. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i> Some copies are dated erroneously March 17. See Arnold’s <i>Rhode Island</i>,
i. 114, note.</p>

<p>For a discussion of the “Narragansett Patent,” so called, issued to Massachusetts,
dated Dec. 10, 1643, see Arnold, i. 118-120; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> for February, 1862,
pp. 401-406; and June, 1862; pp. 41-77.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>The original charter of Charles II., dated July 8, 1663, is extant. It was first printed
as prefixed to the earliest digest of laws (Boston, 1719), and has been often reprinted.</p>

<p>The incorporation of Providence plantations under the charter of 1643/44 was delayed
for several years, and took place in 1647, when a code of laws was adopted. This code was
first printed in 1847, edited by Judge William R. Staples, in a volume entitled <i>The Proceedings
of the First General Assembly of “the Incorporation of Providence Plantations,”
and the Code of Laws adopted by that Assembly in 1647, with Notes, Historical and
Explanatory</i> (64 pages). The original manuscript of these laws is in a volume of the
early records in the Secretary of State’s office.</p>

<p>The earliest printed digest of laws, entitled <i>Acts and Laws</i>, was in 1719,&mdash;printed at
Boston “for John Allen and Nicholas Boone.”<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> In this, the following clause appears
as part of a law purporting to have been enacted in March, 1663-64: “And that all men
professing Christianity, and of competent estates and of civil conversation, who acknowledge
and are obedient to the civil magistrate, though of different judgments in religious
affairs (<i>Roman Catholics only excepted</i>), shall be admitted freemen, and shall have liberty
to choose and be chosen officers in the colony, both military and civil.” This same clause
appears in the four following printed digests named above, and it remained a law of the
colony till February, 1783, when the General Assembly formally repealed so much of it as
related to Roman Catholics. Rhode Island writers consider it a serious reflection upon
the character of the founders of the colony to assert that this clause was enacted at the
time indicated; and one writer (Judge Eddy, in <i>Walsh’s Appeal</i>, 2d ed., p. 433) thinks it
possible that the clause was inserted in a manuscript copy of the laws sent over to England
in 1699, without, of course, being enacted into a law. The clause, it is said, does not
exist in manuscript in the archives of the colony, and is not in the manuscript digest of
1708, though Mr. Arnold, <i>History</i>, ii. 492, inadvertently says it is there. If the clause
was originally smuggled in among the statutes of Rhode Island at a later period than
the date assigned to it (see <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1872-73, p. 64), it was five times formally
re-enacted when the several digests named above were submitted by their revising
committees, and passed the General Assembly; and it remained a law till 1783.</p>

<p>In 1762, two persons professing the Jewish religion petitioned the Superior Court of
the colony to be made citizens. Their prayer was rejected. The concluding part of the
opinion of the court is as follows: “Further, by the charter granted to this colony it
appears that the free and quiet enjoyment of the Christian religion and a desire of
propagating the same were the principal views with which this colony was settled, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
a law made and passed in the year 1663, no person who does not profess the Christian
religion can be admitted free of this colony. This Court, therefore, unanimously dismiss
this petition, as wholly inconsistent with the first principles upon which the colony was
founded and a law of the same now in force” (Arnold, <i>History</i>, ii. 492-495). Arnold says
that previous to this decision several Jews and Roman Catholics had been naturalized as
citizens by special acts of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Has there not been a misapprehension as to the bearing of this law or clause disfranchising
or refusing to admit to the franchise Roman Catholics and persons not Christians,
and as to Roger Williams’s doctrine of religious liberty? The charter of Rhode
Island declared that no one should be “molested ... or called in question for any
differences of opinion in matters of religion.” The law in question does not relate to
religious liberty, but to the franchise. Rhode Island has always granted liberty to persons
of every religious opinion, but has placed a hedge about the franchise; and this clause
does it. Was it not natural for the founders of Rhode Island to keep the government in
the hands of its friends while working out their experiment, rather than to put it into the
hands of the enemies of religious liberty? How many shiploads of Roman Catholics
would it have taken to swamp the little colony in the days of its weakness? Chalmers
(<i>Annals</i>, p. 276) copied his extract of the law in question from the digest of 1730, as per
minutes formerly belonging to him in my possession. As an historian where could he
seek for higher authority? Indeed, the clause had already been cited by Douglass in his
<i>Summary</i>, ii. 83, Boston, 1751; and by the authors of the <i>History of the British Dominions
in North America</i>, part i. p. 232, London, 1773. The latter as well as Chalmers
omitted the phrase “professing Christianity.” But Chalmers was entirely wrong in his
comments upon the clause where he says that “a persecution was immediately commenced
against the Roman Catholics.”<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<h4>THE WINTHROP MAP (<i>Circa 1633</i>).</h4>

<p class="drop-cap16">AMONG the Sloane manuscripts in the
British Museum is one numbered
“Add: 5,415, G. 3,” whose peculiar interest
to the American antiquary escaped notice
till Mr. Henry F. Waters sent photographs
of it to the Public Library in Boston in
1884, when one of them was laid before the
Massachusetts Historical Society by Judge
Chamberlain, of that Library (<i>Proceedings</i>,
1884, p. 211). It was of the size of the
original, somewhat obscure, and a little deficient
on the line where its two parts joined.
At the Editor’s request, Mr. Richard Garnett,
of the British Museum, procured a
negative on a single glass; and though somewhat
reduced, the result, as shown in the
accompanying fac-simile, is more distinct,
and no part is lost.</p>

<p>The map is without date. The topography
corresponds in the main with that of
the map which William Wood added to his
<i>New England’s Prospect</i> (London, 1634), so
far as its smaller field corresponds, and suggests
the common use of an earlier survey by
the two map-makers,&mdash;if, indeed, Wood did
not depend in part on this present survey.
That its observations were the best then
made would seem clear from the fact that
Governor Winthrop explained it by a marginal
key, and added in some places a further
description to that given by the draughtsman
(as a change in the handwriting would
seem to show,&mdash;for instance, in the legend
on the Merrimac River), if indeed all is not
Winthrop’s. Who the draughtsman was is
not known. There had been in the colony
a man experienced in surveying,&mdash;Thomas
Graves,&mdash;who laid out Charlestown, before
Winthrop’s arrival; but he is not known to
have remained till the period of the present
survey, which, if there has been nothing added
to the original draught, was seemingly made
as early as that given by Wood. This last
traveller left New England, Aug. 15, 1633;
and his description of the plantations about
Boston at that time, which he professes to
make complete, is almost identical with the
enumeration on this map, though he gives a
few more local names. Wood’s map is
dated 1634; but it seems certain that he
carried it with him in August, 1633,&mdash;a date
as late apparently as can be attached to the
present draught.</p>
<p>The key added by Winthrop to the north
corner of the map reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pi4 p1"><b>A</b>: <i>an Iland cont[aining] 100 acres,
where the Gouven<sup>r</sup>. hathe an orchard &amp; a
vineyarde.</i><br />

house.</i><br />

<b>D</b>: the fforte  } at Boston.<br />

<p class="p1"><i>So far as the rivers are laid thus [shaded],
they are navigable w<sup>th</sup> the Tide.</i></p>

<p class="pc1">[<span class="smcap">SCALE.</span>]</p>

<p class="pi4"><i>Scale of 10: Italian miles<br />
320 pches [perches] to the mile,<br />
not taken by Instrument, but by estimate.</i></p>

<p class="p1">In the north the Merrimac is shown to
be navigable to <i>a fall</i>. The stream itself is
marked <i>Merimack river; it runnes 100 miles
up into the Country, and falles out of a ponde
10 miles broad</i>. It receives the <i>Musketaquit
riuer</i> [Concord] just south of the scale.
The long island near its mouth is Plum Island,
but it is not named. The village of
<i>Agawam</i> [Ipswich] is connected by roads
[dotted lines] with <i>Sagus</i> [Saugus], <i>Salem</i>,
<i>Winesemett</i>, and <i>Meadford</i>, which is called
“Misticke” in Wood’s text, but “Meadford”
in his map. On <i>Cape Anne</i> peninsula
<i>Anasquom</i> is marked. The bay between
Marblehead and Marblehead Neck is called
<i>Marble Harbour</i>, as by Wood in his map.
<i>Nahant</i> is marked, as are also <i>Pulln Point</i>,
<i>Deere I.</i>, <i>Hogg I.</i>, <i>Nottles I.</i> Governor’s
Island is marked <i>A.</i>, referring to the key.
Charlestown is called <i>Char:towne</i>. <i>Spott
Ponde</i> flows properly through Malden River,
not named, into the Mystic; and <i>Mistick
river</i> takes the water of a number of ponds.
The modern Horn Pond in Woburn is not
shown. The three small ponds near a hill
appear to be Wedge Pond and others in
Winchester; the main water is <i>Mistick pond,
60 fathoms deepe; horn ponde</i> is the modern
Spy Pond; Fresh Pond is called 40 <i>fathom
deepe</i>. Their watershed is separated by the
Belmont hills, not named, from the valley of
the Concord. The villages of <i>Waterton</i>
and <i>Newtowne</i> [Cambridge] are marked on
the <i>Charls River</i>. The peninsula of <i>Boston</i>
shows Beacon Hill, not named, while <i>C</i>
and <i>D</i> are explained in the key. <i>Muddy
river</i> [Muddy Brook in Brookline] and
<i>Stony river</i> [Stony Brook in Roxbury] are
correctly placed. <i>Rocksbury</i> and <i>Dorchester</i>
appear as villages. Hills are shown on
Dorchester Neck, or South Boston. <i>Naponsett
river</i> is placed with tolerable correctness.
The islands in Boston Harbor are
all represented as wooded. The <i>waye to
Plimouth</i>, beginning at Dorchester, crosses
the Weymouth rivers above <i>Wessaguscus</i>
[Wessagussett]. Trees and eminences
are marked on <i>Nataskette</i> [Hull], and Cohasset
is called <i>Conyhassett</i>. The same
sign stands for rocks in the Bay and for
Indian villages on the land.</p>

<h3><a name="c380" id="c380">EDITORIAL NOTES.</a></h3>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Bibliographical.</span>&mdash;Rhode Island has
been fortunate in its bibliographer. Mr. John
Russell Bartlett, the editor of the State’s early
<i>Records</i>, issued at Providence, in 1864, his <i>Bibliography
of Rhode Island, with Notes, Historical,
Biographical, and Critical</i> (150 copies printed).
Mr. Bartlett began a “Naval History of Rhode
Island” in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, January,
1870. As the adviser of the late Mr. John
Carter Brown in the forming of what is now so
widely known as the Carter-Brown Library, and
as the cataloguer of its almost unexampled
treasures, not only of Rhode Island, but of all
American history, Mr. Bartlett has also conferred
upon the student of American history benefits
equalled in the labors of few other scholars in
this department. Mr. Brown erected for himself
in his Library a splendid monument. There may
exist in the Lenox Library a rival in some departments
of Americana, but Mr. Bartlett’s Catalogue
of the Providence Collection makes its
richness better known. Mr. Brown began his
collections early, and was enabled to buy from
the catalogues of Rich and Ternaux. The Library
is now so complete, and its <i>desiderata</i> are
so few and so scarce, that it grows at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
but slowly. Mr. Brown, a son of Nicholas
Brown, from whom the university in Providence
received its name, was born in 1797, and died
June 10, 1874. But fifty copies of the two sumptuous
volumes (1482-1700) constituting the revised
edition of the catalogue (there
is a third volume, 1700-1800, in a first
edition) have been distributed, and
they are the Library’s best history;
but those not fortunate enough to
have access to them will find accounts
of it in the <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>, April,
1876; Rogers’s <i>Libraries of Providence;
N.E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, April, 1876;
<i>American Journal of Education</i>, xxvii. 237;
<i>American Bibliopolist</i>, vi. 77, vii. 91, 228.</p>

<p>The several volumes of the Rhode Island
Historical Society, so far as they relate to the
period under examination, are noted in the preceding
text; but the Society has also issued a
volume of <i>Proceedings</i> for the years 1872-1879.
Two supplemental publications of the Rhode
Island antiquaries have been begun lately,&mdash;the
<i>Newport Historical Magazine</i>, July, 1880, and
the <i>Narragansett Historical Register</i>, July, 1882,
James N. Arnold, editor, both devoted to southern
Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Early Maps of New England.</span>&mdash;The
cartography of New England in the seventeenth
century began with the map of Captain John
Smith in 1614 (given in chap. vi.), for we must
discard as of little value the earlier maps of
Lescarbot and Champlain. The Dutch were on
the coast at about the same time, and the best
development of their work is what is known as
the “Figurative Map” of 1614, which was first
made known in the <i>Documents relating to the
Colonial History of New York</i>, i. 13, and in
O’Callaghan’s <i>New Netherland</i>. The part showing
New England is figured in the <i>Memorial
History of Boston</i>, i. 57. It had certain features
which long remained on the maps, and its names
became in later maps curiously mixed with those
derived from Smith’s map. It gave the Cape Cod
peninsula (here, however, made an island) a peculiar
triangular shape; it exaggerated Plymouth’s
harbor; it ran Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket
into one, and divided Long Island into several
parts. The marked feature of the interior was
the bringing of the Iroquois (Champlain) Lake
close down to the salt water, as Champlain had
done in his map of 1612, and as he continued to
do in his larger map of 1632. Blaeu, in his
<i>Atlas</i> of 1635, while he copied the Figurative
Map pretty closely, closed the channel which
made Cape Cod an island, and gave the “Lacus
Irocociensis” a prolongation in the direction
of Narragansett Bay. De Laet, in 1630, had
worked on much better information in several
respects. Cape Cod is much more nearly its
proper shape; and he had got such information
from the Dutch settlements up the Hudson as
enabled him to place Lake Champlain with fair
accuracy. A fac-simile of De Laet’s map is given
in Vol. IV. chap. ix. Meanwhile the English had
enlarged Smith’s plot, as the map given on an
earlier page from Alexander and Purchas (<i>Pilgrimes</i>,
iii. 853) shows. Champlain’s plotting in
1632 of the great river of Canada could not,
of course, have been known to this map-maker
of 1624, while Lescarbot’s was.</p>

</div>

<p>Pure local work came in with the map which
accompanied Wood’s <i>New England’s Prospect</i>,
which is called “The south part of New England
as it is planted this yeare, 1634.” It only
shows the coast from Narragansett Bay to
“Acomenticus,” on the Maine shore, with a
corresponding inland delineation. Buzzard’s
Bay is greatly misshapen; Cape Cod has something
of the contemporary Dutch drawing; and,
in a rude way, the watercourses lie like huge
snakes in contortions upon the land. There are
fac-similes of the map in Palfrey, i. 360; Young’s
<i>Chronicles of Massachusetts</i>, p. 389, and in other
places noted in the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>,
i. 524. Two years later (1636), in Saltonstall’s
English version of the atlas of Mercator and
Hondius, the English public practically got De
Laet’s map; and indeed so late as 1670, the
map “Novi Belgii et Novæ Angliæ Delineatio,”
which is given alike in Montanus’s <i>De Nieuwe
en Onbekende Weereld</i> and in Ogilby’s <i>America</i>,
hardly embodied more exact information. The
Hexham English version of the Mercator-Hondius
Atlas, intended for the English market, but
published in Amsterdam by Hondius and Jannson
in 1636 (of which there is a fine copy in the
library of the Massachusetts Historical Society),
in its map of “Nova Anglia,” etc., kept up the
commingling of Smith’s plot and names with
the present Dutch ones. Blaeu’s of 1635 was
the prototype of the chart in Dudley’s <i>Arcano
del Mare</i> (1646), of which a fac-simile is given
in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>For the next twenty
years the Dutch plotting was the one in vogue.
Visscher, in 1652, disjoined the two principal islands
south of Cape Cod, and gave a better shape
to that peninsula; but Crane Bay (Plymouth) continued
to be more prominent than Boston. The
French map of Sanson (1656) so far followed the
Dutch as to recognize the claims of “Nouveau
Pays Bas” to stretch through Connecticut, Rhode
Island, and Plymouth Colony, as shown in the
sketch in chap. xi. The old Dutch mistakes
and the Dutch names characterize Hendrick
Doncker’s <i>Paskaert</i>, in 1659, and other of the
Hollanders’ sea-charts of this time. In 1660,
François du Creux’s (Creuxius) <i>Historia Canadensis</i>
converts into a Latin nomenclature, in a
curious jumble, the names of the English, Dutch,
and French. This map is given in fac-simile in
Shea’s <i>Mississippi</i>, p. 50, and also in Vol. IV. of
the present work. The next year (1661) Van
Loon’s <i>Pascaerte</i> was based on Blaeu and De
Laet, and his <i>Zee-Atlas</i>, though not recognized
by Asher, represents the best knowledge of
the time. There is a copy in Harvard College
Library. There are other maps of Visscher of
about this same time, in which Cape Cod becomes
as excessively attenuated as it had been
too large before.</p>

<p>Of the later Dutch charts or
maps, the chief place must be given to that in
Roggeveen’s Sea-Atlas, which is called in the
English version <i>The Burning Fen</i>, and which
still insists in calling the Cape Cod peninsula in
1675 a part of “Nieuw Holland,” as does one
of Jannson’s of about the same date, in which
Smith’s names survive marvellously when those
of other towns had long taken their places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
A map, <i>La Nouvelle Belgique</i>, covering also New
England, and fashioned on one of Jannson’s, is
annexed to an article, “Une Colonie Néerlandaise,”
by Colonel H. Wauwermans, in the <i>Bulletin
de la Société Géographique d’Anvers</i>, iv.
173. The Blaeu map, “Nova Belgica et Anglia
Nova,” found in the Atlas of 1685, still preserves
most of the older Dutch falsities; and
that geographer made no one of these errors
so conspicuous as he did in making still nearer
than before the approach of “Lacus Irocociensis”
to Narragansett Bay. A short dotted
boundary-line is made to connect them, and he
dispelled the old Dutch claim to southeastern
New England, by putting “Nieu Engelland”
east of this line, and “Nieu Nederlandt” west
of it. This map was substantially followed in
Allard’s <i>Minor Atlas</i>, of a few years later. A
new English cartography sprang up when there
came a demand for geographical knowledge, as
the events of Philip’s War engaged general attention.
The royal geographer Speed issued
in 1676 a map of New England and New York
in his <i>Prospect</i>; but he seems to have followed
Visscher and the other Dutch authorities implicitly,
as did Coronelli and Tillemon in the New
England parts of their map of Canada issued
in 1688. Stevens, in his <i>Bibliotheca Geographica</i>,
p. 229, notes an English map of New England
and New York, which he supposes to belong
to 1690, “sold by T. Bassett, in Fleet
Street,” which is seemingly enlarged from so
early a Dutch map as De Laet’s of 1625. The
text of Josselyn’s <i>Voyages</i> was used as the basis of
<i>A Description of New England</i>, which accompanied
in folio a folded plate, entitled “Mapp of
New England, by John Seller, Hydrographer to
the King.” It is without date, but is mentioned
in the <i>London Gazette</i> in 1676, and could not have
appeared earlier than 1674, when Josselyn’s book
was printed. There is a copy in Harvard College
Library; and it shows the coast from Casco
Bay to New York, with a corresponding interior.
These are precisely the bounds in the map which
is given in Mather’s <i>Magnalia</i> in 1702, and which
seems, in parts at least, to have been drawn from
Seller’s. Sabin (<i>Dictionary</i>, vol. xiii. no. 52,629)
gives <i>A Description of New England in general,
with a Description of the Town of Boston in particular</i>,
London, John Seller, 1682, 4º. Seller is
also known to have issued a small sketch map in
his <i>New England Almanac</i>, 1685 (copy in Harvard
College Library); and still another, of which a
fac-simile is given in Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, iii.
489. There is a map (5 x 4½ inches) of New
England by Robert Morden in R. Blome’s <i>Present
State of his Majesty’s Isles and Territories in
America</i>, 1687, p. 210, which is based on Seller’s,
and which has been reproduced by the Bradford
Club in their <i>Papers concerning the Attack
on Hatfield and Deerfield</i>, New York, 1859. A
different map, extending to New France and
Greenland, is given in the Amsterdam editions
of Blome, 1688 and 1715. Hubbard’s map, accompanying
his <i>Narrative of the Troubles in
New England</i>, 1677, a rude woodcut,&mdash;the first
attempt at such work in the colony,&mdash;extends
only to the Connecticut westerly; but northerly
it goes far enough to take in the White Hills,
which in the London reissue of the map are
called “Wine Hills.” This is also given by Palfrey,
iii. 155, after the London plate, and further
notes upon it will be found in the <i>Memorial
History of Boston</i>, i. 328. There is also a detailed
delineation of the New England coast in
John Thornton’s <i>Atlas Maritimus</i>, 1701-21.</p>

<p>In this enumeration of the maps or charts
which give New England, or any considerable
part of it, on a scale sufficient for detail, it is
thought that every significant draft is mentioned,
though some repetitions, particularly by
the Dutch, have been purposely omitted.</p>

<p>Modern maps of New England, which indicate
the condition of this period, will be found
in Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, vol. i., showing the
geography of 1644, and in vol. iii. that of 1689;
and in Uhden’s <i>Geschichte der Congregationalisten,

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE ENGLISH IN NEW YORK, 1664-1689.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JOHN AUSTIN STEVENS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE trading spirit is not of itself sufficient to establish successful settlement,
and monopolies cannot safely be intrusted with the government
of colonies. The experience of the Dutch in the New Netherland
established this truth, which later experience has fully confirmed.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the seventeenth century Holland controlled the
carrying trade of the world. Nearly one half of the tonnage of Europe
was under her flag. Java was the centre of her East Indian enterprise,
Brazil the seat of her West Indian possessions; and the seas between, over
which were wafted her fleets, freighted with the rich products of these tropical
lands, were patrolled by a navy hardy and brave. Yet it was at the
very zenith of her power that her North American colony, which proudly
bore the name of the Fatherland, was stripped from the home government
at one trenchant blow.</p>

<p>The cause of this misfortune may be found in the weakness of the Dutch
settlement compared with the more populous New England communities,
which pressed, threatening and aggressive, on its eastern borders. Under
the Dutch rule, New Netherland was never in a true sense a colony.
Begun as a trading-post in 1621, and managed by the Dutch West India
Company, it cannot be said ever to have got beyond leading-strings, and
at the time when it fell into the hands of the English its entire population
did not exceed seven thousand souls, while the English on its borders
numbered not less than fifteen times as many.</p>

<p>Nor did the West India Company seem ever to comprehend that their
hold upon the new continent could be maintained only by well-ordered and
continuous colonization. Rapidly enriched by their intercourse with the
natives of the sunny climes in which they established their strong posts for
trade, they seem to have looked for no more from their posts on the North
American coast, or to have had further ambition than to secure their share
of the trade in furs, in which they were met by the active rivalry and greater
enterprise of the French settlers on the Canadian frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the territory of New Netherland was by natural configuration the
key of the northern frontier of the American colonies, and indeed, it may
be said, of the continent. The courses of the Hudson and Mohawk form
the sides of a natural strategic triangle, and with the system of northern
lakes and streams connect the several parts of the broad surface which
stretches from the mouth of the St. Lawrence on the Atlantic to the headwaters
of the Columbia at the continental divide. This vantage-ground
at the head of the great valleys through which water-ways give access to
the regions on the slope below, was the chosen site of the formidable
confederacy of the Iroquois, the acknowledged masters of the native
tribes.</p>

<p>The English jealousy of the Dutch did not spring from national antipathy,
but from the rivalry of trade. The insular position of England
forced her to protect herself abroad, and when Protestant Holland, by
enterprise and skill, drew to herself the commerce of both the Indies, her
success aroused in England the same spirit of opposition, the same animosity,
which had, the century before, been awakened by the aggrandizement
of Catholic Spain. It was the Protestant Commonwealth of England
which passed the Navigation Act of 1660, especially directed against the
foreign trade of her growing rival of the same religious faith. In this act
may be found the germ of the policy of England not only toward her
neighbors, but also toward her colonies. This act was maintained in active
force after the restoration of Charles II. to the throne. Strictly enforced
at home, it was openly or secretly evaded only in the British American colonies
and plantations. The arm of England was long, but her hand lay
lightly on the American continent. The extent of coast and frontier was
too great to be successfully watched, and the necessities of the colonies too
many and imperious for them to resist the temptation to a trade which,
though illicit, was hardly held immoral except by the strictest constructionists
of statute law; and it was with the Dutch that this trade was
actively continued by their English neighbors of Maryland and Virginia,
as well as by those of New England. In 1663 the losses to the revenue
were so extensive that the farmers of the customs, who, after the fashion of
the period, enjoyed a monopoly from the King at a large annual personal
cost, complained of the great abuses which, they claimed, defrauded the
revenue of ten thousand pounds a year. The interest of the kingdom was
at stake, and the conquest of the New Netherland was resolved upon.</p>

<p>This was no new policy. It had been that of Cromwell, the most sagacious
of English rulers, and was only abandoned by him because of the more
immediate advantages secured by his treaty with the Grand Pensionary, a
statesman only second to Oliver himself. The expedition which Cromwell
had ordered was countermanded, and the Dutch title to the New Netherland
was formally recognized by the treaty of 1654. It seems rational
to suppose that the English Protector foresaw the inevitable future fall of
the Dutch-American settlement, hemmed in by growing English colonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
fostered by religious zeal, and that he was willing to wait till the fruit was
ripe and of easy grasp to England.</p>

<p>It is the fashion of historians to ascribe the seizure of the New Netherland
to the perfidy of Charles; but the policy of kingdoms through successive
administrations is more homogeneous than appears on the surface. The
diplomacy of ministers is usually traditional; the opportunity which seems
to mark a change is often but an incident in the chain. That which presented
itself to Clarendon, Charles’s Lord Chancellor, was the demand made
by the States-General that the boundary line should be established between
the Dutch and English possessions in America. Consent on the part of
Charles would have been a ratification of Cromwell’s recognition of 1654.
This demand of the Dutch Government, made in January, 1664, close upon
the petition of the farmers of the customs of December, 1663, precipitated
the crisis. The seizure of New Amsterdam and the reduction of New
Netherland was resolved upon. Three Americans who happened to be
in London,&mdash;Scott, Baker, and Maverick,&mdash;were summoned before the
Council Board, when they presented a statement of the title of the King,
the intrusion of the Dutch, and of the condition of the settlement. The
Chancellor held their arguments to be well grounded, and on the 29th of
February an expedition was ordered “against the Dutch in America.”
The demand of the Holland Government was no doubt stimulated by the
intrigues of Sir George Downing, who had been Cromwell’s ambassador at
the Hague, and was retained by Charles as an adroit servant. A nephew
of the elder Winthrop and a graduate from Harvard, Downing appears
to have determined upon the acquisition by England of the Dutch provinces,
which were held by the New England party to be a thorn in the
side of English American colonization. The expedition determined upon,
Scott was sent back to New England with a royal commission to enforce
the Navigation Laws. The next concern of the Chancellor was to secure
to the Crown the full benefit of the proposed conquest. He was as
little satisfied with the self-rule of the New England colonies as with the
presence of Dutch sovereignty on American soil; and in the conquest of
the foreigner he found the means to bring the English subject into closer
dependence on the King.</p>

<p>James Duke of York, Lord High Admiral, was the heir to the crown.
He had married the daughter of Edward Hyde, the Chancellor of the
kingdom, who now controlled its foreign policy. A patent to James as
presumptive heir to the crown, from the King his brother, would merge
in the crown; and a central authority strongly established over the territory
covered by it might well, under favorable circumstances, be extended
over the colonies on either side which were governed under limitations and
with privileges directly secured by charter from the King. In this adroit
scheme may be found the beginning in America of that policy of personal
rule, which, begun under the Catholic Stuart, culminated under the Protestant
Hanoverian, a century later, in the oppression which aroused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
American Revolution. The first step taken by Clarendon was the purchase
of the title conveyed to the Earl of Stirling in 1635 by the grantees of the
New England patent. This covered the territory of Pemaquid, between the
Saint Croix and the Kennebec, in Maine, and the Island of Matowack, or Long
Island. The Stirling claim had been opposed and resisted by the Dutch;
but Stuyvesant, the Director of New Netherland, had in 1650 formally surrendered
to the English all the territory south of Oyster Bay on Long Island
and east of Greenwich on the continent. A title being thus acquired by the
adroitness of Clarendon, a patent was, on the 12th of March, 1664, issued by
Charles II. to the Duke of York, granting him the Maine territory of Pemaquid,
all the islands between Cape Cod and the Narrows, the Hudson River,
and all the lands from the west side of the Connecticut to the east side of
Delaware Bay, together with the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.
The inland boundary was “a line from the head of Connecticut River to
the source of Hudson River, thence to the head of the Mohawk branch of
Hudson River, and thence to the east side of Delaware Bay.” The patent
gave to the Duke of York, his heirs, deputies, and assigns, “absolute power
to govern within this domain according to his own rules and discretions consistent
with the statutes of England.” In this patent the charter granted
by the King to the younger John Winthrop in 1662 for Connecticut, in
which it was stipulated that commissioners should be sent to New England
to settle the boundaries of each colony, was entirely disregarded. The
idea of commissioners for boundaries now developed with larger scope, and
the King established a royal commission, consisting of four persons recommended
by the Duke of York, whose private instructions were to reduce the
Dutch to submission and to increase the prerogatives of the Crown in the
New England colonies, which Clarendon considered to be “already well-nigh
ripened to a commonwealth.”</p>

</div>

<p>Three of these commissioners were officers in the Royal army,&mdash;Colonel
Richard Nicolls, Sir Robert Carr, Colonel George Cartwright. The
fourth was Samuel
Maverick, an earnest
adherent of the
Church of England
and bitter enemy
of Massachusetts, in
which colony he had
passed his early manhood.
These commissioners,
or any
three or two of them,&mdash;Nicolls
always included,&mdash;were
invested with full power in all matters, military and civil,
in the New England colonies. To Colonel Nicolls the Duke of York entrusted
the charge of taking possession of and governing the vast territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
covered by the King’s patent. To one more capable and worthy the delicate
trust could not have been confided. He was in the fortieth year of a
life full of experience, of a good Bedfordshire family, his father a barrister
of the Middle Temple. He had received an excellent education. When,
at the age of nineteen, the Civil War broke out, he at once joined the
King’s forces, and, obtaining command of a troop of horse, clung persistently
to the Royal cause. Later, he served on the Continent with the
Duke of York in the army of Turenne. At the Restoration he was rewarded
for his fidelity with the post of Groom of the Bedchamber to the
Duke, to whose interests he devoted himself with loyalty, prudence, and
untiring energy. His title under the new commission was that of Deputy-Governor;
the tenure of his office, the Duke’s pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>The English Government has never been scrupulous as to method in the
attainment of its purposes, justification being a secondary matter. When
the news of the gathering of the fleet reached the Hague, and explanation
was demanded of Downing as to the truth of the reports that it was
intended for the reduction of the New Netherland, he boldly insisted on
the English right to the territory by first possession. To a claim so flimsy
and impudent only one response was possible,&mdash;a declaration of war. But
the Dutch people at large had little interest in the remote settlement, which
was held to be a trading-post rather than a colony, and not a profitable
post at best. The West India Company saw the danger of the situation,
but its appeals for assistance were disregarded. Its own resources and
credit were unequal to the task of defence. Meanwhile the English fleet,
composed of one ship of thirty-six, one of thirty, a third of sixteen, and
a transport of ten guns, with three full companies of the King’s veterans,&mdash;in
all four hundred and fifty men, commanded by Colonels Nicolls, Carr, and
Cartwright,&mdash;sailed from Portsmouth for Gardiner’s Bay on the 15th of
May. On the 23d of July Nicolls and Cartwright reached Boston, where
they demanded military aid from the Governor and Council of the Colony.
Calling upon Winthrop for the assistance of Connecticut, and appointing a
rendezvous at the west end of Long Island, Nicolls set sail with his ships and
anchored in New Utrecht Bay, just outside of Coney Island, a spot since historical
as the landing-place of Lord Howe’s troops in 1776. Here Nicolls
was joined by militia from New Haven and Long Island. The city of New
Amsterdam was at once cut off from all communication with the shores
opposite, and a proclamation was issued by the commissioners guaranteeing
the inhabitants in their possessions on condition of submission. The
Hudson being in the control of the English vessels, the little city was defenceless.
The Director, Stuyvesant, heard of the approach of the English
at Fort Orange (Albany), whither he had gone to quell disturbances with
the Indians. Returning in haste, he summoned his council together.
The folly of resistance was apparent to all, and after delays, by which the
Director-General sought to save something of his dignity, a commission for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
a surrender was agreed upon between the Dutch authorities and Colonel
Nicolls. The capitulation confirmed the inhabitants in the possession of
their property, the exercise of their religion, and their freedom as citizens.
The municipal officers were continued in their rule. On the 29th of August,
1664, the articles were ratified, and Stuyvesant marched out from Fort
Amsterdam, at the head of his little band with the honors of war, and
embarked the troops on one of the West India Company’s ships for Holland.
Stuyvesant himself remained for a time in the city. The English
entered the fort, the Dutch flag was hauled down, the English colors
hoisted in its place, and the city passed under English rule. The first
act of Nicolls on taking possession of the fort, in which he was welcomed
by the civic authorities, was to order that the city of New Amsterdam be
thereafter known as New York, and the fort as Fort James, in honor of the
title and name of his lord and patron.</p>

<p>At the time of the surrender the city gave small promise of its magnificent
future. Its entire population, which did not exceed 1,500 souls, was
housed within the triangle at the point of the island, the easterly and
westerly sides of which were the East and North Rivers, and the northern
boundary a wall stretching across the entire island from river to river.
Beyond this limit was an occasional plantation and a small hamlet known
as New Haarlem. The seat of government was in the fort. Nicolls now
established a new government for the province. A force was sent up the
Hudson under Captain Cartwright, which took possession of Fort Orange,
the name of which was changed to Albany, in honor of a title of the Duke
of York. On his return, Cartwright took possession of Esopus in the same
manner (the name of this settlement was later changed to Kingston).
The privileges granted to the inhabitants of New Amsterdam were extended
to these towns. The volunteers from Long Island and New England were
now discharged to their homes.</p>

<p>The effect of the prudent and conciliatory measures of Nicolls, which in
the beginning had averted the shedding of a single drop of blood, and now
appealed directly to the good sense of the inhabitants, was soon apparent.
The fears of the Dutch were entirely allayed, and as no inequality was imposed
upon them, they had no reason to regret the change of rule. Their
pride was conciliated by the continuance of their municipal authorities, and
by the cordial manner in which the new-comers arranged that the Dutch and
English religious service should be held consecutively under the same roof,&mdash;that
of the Dutch church in the fort. Hence when Nicolls, alive to the
interests of his master, which could be served only by maintaining the prosperity
of the colony, proposed to the chief citizens that instead of returning
to Holland, as had been arranged for in the capitulation, they should take
the oath of allegiance to the King of Great Britain and of obedience to the
Duke of York, they almost without exception, Stuyvesant himself included,
accepted the conditions. The King’s authority was thus peaceably and
firmly established in the metropolis and in the outlying posts of the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of New York proper, which, by the King’s patent to the Duke, included
all the territory east of the Delaware. The commissioners next proceeded
to reduce the Dutch settlements on the Delaware, and established their colleague,
Carr, in command, always however in subordination to the government
of New York. The necessities of their condition, dependent upon
trade, brought the Dutch inhabitants into easy subjection. Indeed it seems
that though their attachment to the mother country, its laws and its customs,
was unabated, the long neglect of their interests by the Holland Government
had greatly weakened if not destroyed any active sentiment of loyalty.</p>

<p>The southern boundary established, the commissioners turned to the
more difficult task of establishing that to the eastward. The Duke of
York’s patent covered all the territory claimed alike by the Dutch and by
the Connecticut colony under its charter of 1662,&mdash;involving an unsettled
controversy. A joint commission finally determined the matter by assigning
Long Island to New York, and establishing a dividing line between
New York and Connecticut, to run about twenty miles distant eastwardly
from the Hudson River. The superior topographical information of the
Connecticut commissioners secured the establishment of this line in a
manner not intended by the Board at large. The boundary was not
ratified by the royal authorities, and was later the source of continual dispute
and of endless bad feeling between the two colonies.</p>

<p>Nicolls next settled the rules of the customs, which were to be paid
in beaver skins at fixed valuations. Courts were now established,&mdash;an
English modification of those already existing among the Dutch. These
new organizations consisted of a court of assizes, or high court of law and
equity. Long Island was divided, after the English manner, into three districts
or ridings, in which courts of sessions were held at stated intervals.
The justices, sitting with the Governor and his Council once in each year
in the Court of Assizes, formed the supreme law-making power, wholly
subordinate to the will of the Governor, and, after him, to the approval of
the Duke. To this body fell the duty of establishing a code of laws for
such parts of the province as still remained under the Dutch forms of
government. Carefully examining the statutes of the New England colonies,
Nicolls prepared from them a code of laws, and summoning a convention
of delegates of towns to meet at Hempstead on Long Island, he
submitted it for their approval. These laws, though liberal in matters of
conscience and religion, did not permit of the election of magistrates. To
this restriction many of the delegates demurred; but Nicolls fell back upon
the terms of his commission, and the delegates submitted with good grace.
The code thus established is known in jurisprudence as the “Duke’s Laws.”
Its significant features were trial by jury; equal taxation; tenure of lands
from the Duke of York; no religious establishment, but requirement of some
church form; freedom of religion to all professing Christianity; obligatory
service in each parish every Sunday; recognition of negro slavery under
certain restrictions; and general liability to military duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in order came the conforming of the style and manner of the city
governments to the custom of England. The Dutch form was abolished,
and a mayor, aldermen, and sheriff appointed. The Dutch citizens objected
to this change from the habit of their forefathers, but as the preponderance
of numbers was given to citizens of their nationality, the objection was not
pressed, and the new authorities were quietly inaugurated, if not with acquiescence,
at least without opposition or protest. These changes occurred
in June, 1665. Thus in less than a single year, in a population the Dutch
element of which outnumbered the English as three to one, by the moderation,
tact, energy, and remarkable administrative ability of Nicolls, was
the conquered settlement assimilated to the English body politic to which
it was henceforth to belong, and from the hour of transmutation it was
accustomed to look to Great Britain itself for government and protection.
Such was the first step in the transition of the seat of the “armed commercial
monopoly” of New Amsterdam, through various modifications and
changes, to the cosmopolitan city of the present day.</p>

<p class="p2">The war which the violent seizure of New Netherland precipitated upon
Europe was little felt on the western shores of the Atlantic. There was
nothing in New York itself, independently of its territorial situation, to tempt
a <i>coup de main</i>. There were “no ships to lose, no goods to plunder.” For
nearly a year after the capture no vessel arrived from England with supplies.
In the interval the King’s troops slept upon canvas and straw. The entire
cost of maintaining the garrison fell upon the faithful Nicolls, who nevertheless
continued to build up and strengthen his government, personally
disposing of the disputes between the soldiers and settlers at the posts,
encouraging settlement by liberal offers to planters, and cultivating friendly
relations with the powerful Indian confederacy on the western frontier.
While thus engaged in the great work of organizing into a harmonious
whole the imperial domain to his charge, which, extending from
the Delaware to the Connecticut, with the Hudson as its central artery, was
of itself a well rounded and perfect kingdom, he received the disagreeable
intelligence that his work of consolidation had been broken by the Duke
of York himself. James, deceived as to gravity of the transaction,
influenced by friendship, or because of more immediate personal considerations,
granted to Carteret and Berkeley the entire territory between the
Hudson River on the east, Cape May on the southward, and the northern
branch of the Delaware on the west, to which was given the name of Nova
Cæsarea or New Jersey. In this grant, however, the Duke of York did
not convey the right of jurisdiction; but the reservation not being expressed
in the document, the grantees claimed that it also passed to
them, an interpretation which received no definitive settlement for a
long period.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>While the Dutch Government showed no disposition to attempt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
recovery of their late American territory by immediate attack, they did not
tamely submit to the humiliation put upon them, but strained every nerve
to maintain the honor of their flag by sea and land. For them as for the
English race, the sea was the natural scene of strife. The first successes
were to the English fleet, which, under the command of the Duke of York
in person, defeated the Dutch at Lowestoffe, and compelled them to withdraw
to the cover of their forts. Alarmed at the triumph of England and
at the prospect of a general war, Louis XIV. urged peace upon the States-General,
and proposed to the English King an exchange of the territory
of New Netherland for the island of Poleron, one of the Banda or Nutmeg
Islands, recently taken from the English,&mdash;a kingdom for a mess of pottage.
But Clarendon rejected the mediation, declining either exchange or
restitution in a manner that forced upon the French King a declaration of
war. This declaration, issued Jan. 29, 1666, was immediately replied to by
England, and the American colonies were directed to reduce the French
possessions to the English crown. Here was the beginning of the strife on
the American continent which culminated a century later in the conquest
of Canada and the final supremacy of the English race on the Western
continent.</p>

<p>While the settlers of New England, cut off from the Western country
by the Hudson River and the Dutch settlements along its course, and alike
from Canada by pathless forests, and in a manner enclosed by races whose
foreign tongues rendered intercourse difficult, were rapidly multiplying in
number, redeeming and cultivating the soil and laying the foundations of a
compact and powerful commonwealth, divided perhaps in form, but one in
spirit and purpose, their northern neighbors were no less active under totally
different forms of polity. The primary idea of French as of Spanish
colonization was the conversion of the heathen tribes. The first empire
sought was that of the soul; the priests were the pioneers of exploration.
The natives of the soil were to be first converted, then brought, if possible,
through this subtile influence into alliance with the home government.
This peaceful scheme failing, military posts were to be established at strategic
points to control the lakes and streams and places of portage, the
highways of Indian travel, and to hold the country subject to the King of
France. Unfortunately for the success of this comprehensive plan, there
was discord among the French themselves. The French military authorities
and the priests were not harmonious either in purpose or in conduct. The
Society of Jesus would not subordinate itself to the royal authority. Moreover
the Iroquois confederacy of the Five Nations, which held the valley of
the Mohawk and the lakes south of Ontario, were not friendly at heart to the
Europeans. They had not forgotten nor forgiven the invasion by Champlain;
yet, recognizing the value of friendly relations with a power which
could supply them with firearms for their contests with the fierce tribes with
whom they were at perpetual war, they welcomed the French to dwell
among them. French policy had declared itself, even before England made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
her first move for a consolidation of her power in America. In 1663 the Old
Canada Company surrendered its rights to Louis XIV., who at once sent
over a Royal Commissary to organize a colonial government. The new
administration established by him was not content with the uncertain
relations existing with the Iroquois, which the fierce hostility of the Mohawks,
the most important and powerful of the confederate tribes, constantly
threatened to turn into direct enmity. A policy of conquest
was determined upon. An embassy sent by the Iroquois to Montreal to
treat for peace in 1664 was coldly received, and the next year the instructions
of the French King declared the Five Nations to be “perpetual
and irreconcilable enemies of the colony.” Strong military assistance
arrived to enforce the new policy, and before the year closed, the Marquis
de Tracy, the new viceroy, had erected fortified posts which controlled the
entire course of the St. Lawrence. In December four of the confederate
tribes,&mdash;the Onondagas, Oneidas, Cayugas, and Senecas,&mdash;alarmed at this
well-ordered progress toward their territory, made submission, and entered
into a treaty by which Louis was acknowledged as their protector and sovereign.
The Mohawks alone were not a party to this arrangement. They
refused to acknowledge subjection. To punish their obstinacy the viceroy
at once despatched an expedition against their villages. Missing its way, it
was attacked near Schenectady by a party of Mohawks. The news of the
skirmish alarmed the English at Albany. From their pickets Courcelles,
the commander of the French expedition, first learned of the reduction of
the Dutch province to English rule, and, it is reported, said in disturbed
mind, “that the King of England did grasp at all America.”</p>

<p>Thus for the first time within the limits of the New York province the
English and French were confronted with each other on the territory which
was destined to become the scene of a century of strife; and thus also were
the Mohawks naturally inclined to the only power which could protect them
against the aggressions of the French. Nicolls induced the Mohawks to
treat for peace with the French. He also urged the Connecticut authorities to
arrange a peace between the Mohicans and the Mohawks; and negotiations
were opened in time to counteract the French emissaries, who were already
tampering with the former tribe. Shortly after these successful mediations,
instructions arrived from King Charles to undertake hostilities against Canada;
but Connecticut refusing to join in an expedition, and Massachusetts, considering
the reduction of Canada as not at the time feasible, Nicolls changed
his tactics, and declared to the Canadian viceroy his purpose to maintain
peace, provided the bounds and limits of his Majesty’s dominions were not
invaded. Meanwhile, the Oneidas having ratified the treaty made by their
colleague tribes with the French, the Mohawks were left alone in resistance,
and committed outrages which the viceroy determined to punish. Leading
an expedition in person, he marched upon the Mohawks, captured and destroyed
their four villages, burned vast quantities of stored provisions, devastated
their territory, and took formal possession of the country in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of the King of France. Yet such was the independent spirit of this proud
tribe, that it required the threat of another expedition to bring them to submission.
A treaty was made by which they consented to receive missionaries.
This completed the title of possession of the Western territory which
the French Government was preparing against a day of need.</p>

<p>The war in Europe was closed by the treaty of Breda, which allowed
the retention by each of the conflicting parties of the places it occupied.
This provision confirmed the English in peaceful and rightful possession of
their conquest of New Netherland. The intelligence was proclaimed New
Year’s Day, 1668. It enabled the Duke of York to accede at last to the
repeated requests of his faithful and
able deputy, and permission was
granted to Nicolls to return to England.
His successor, Colonel Francis
Lovelace, relieved him in his charge
in August following.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Francis Lovelace, the successor of
Nicolls, continued his policy with prudence and moderation. To him the
merchants of the city owed the establishment of the first exchange or
meeting-place for transaction of business at fixed hours. He encouraged
the fisheries and whaling, promoted domestic trade with Virginia, Massachusetts,
and the West India Islands, and took personal interest in ship-building.
By his encouragement the first attempt toward a post-road or
king’s highway was made. During his administration the first seal was
secured for the province, and one also for the city. He appears to have
concerned himself also in the conversion to Christianity of the Indian
tribes,&mdash;a policy which Nicolls initiated; but as yet there was no printing
press in the province to second his efforts. Of more practical benefit
was his interference to arrest the sale of intoxicating liquors to the savage
tribes from the trading-post at Albany.</p>

<p>In 1668 the policy of the English Government again veered. A treaty,
known as the Triple Alliance, was signed between Great Britain, the United
Provinces, and Sweden, to arrest the growing power and ambitious designs
of France. Popular in the mother country, the alliance gave peculiar satisfaction
to the New York province, and somewhat allayed the disappointment
with which the cancellation of the order permitting the Dutch freely
to trade with New York was received by its citizens of Holland descent.
Throughout the Duke’s province there was entire religious toleration.
None were disturbed in the exercise of their worship. At Albany the
parochial Dutch church was maintained under his authority, and in New
York, he authorized the establishment of a branch of the Dutch Reformed
Church, and directed the payment of a sufficient salary to the minister
invited from Holland to undertake its charge.</p>

<p>The efforts begun by Nicolls and continued by Lovelace, to bring into
harmonious subjection the diverse elements of the Duke’s government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
were not wholly successful. The inhabitants of eastern Long Island clung
tenaciously to the traditions of the Connecticut colony, and petitioned the
King directly for representation in the Government; but the Council for Plantations
denied the claim, on the ground that the territory was in the limits
of the Duke of York’s patent and government. The unsettled boundaries
again gave trouble, Massachusetts renewing her claim to the navigation of
the Hudson, which the Dutch had, during their rule, successfully resisted.
Massachusetts further claimed the territory to the Pacific westward of the
line of the Duke of York’s patent. The contiguous territory was however
held by the Mohawks, who had never acknowledged other sovereignty than
their own. In 1672 this tribe made a considerable sale of lands on the
Mohawk River to the inhabitants of Schenectady, by which New York practically
acquired title to the soil as well as sovereignty.</p>

<p>In 1672 English politics again underwent a change. The Triple Alliance
was dissolved, and a secret treaty entered into with France. War was
declared against the Dutch. In a severe action at Solebay, the Dutch won
an advantage over the allied fleets of England and France. In the engagement
Nicolls, the late governor of the New York province, fell, killed by a
cannon ball, at the feet of his master, the Duke of York, Lord High Admiral
of England, who commanded the British fleet. But while the Dutch maintained
an equality at sea with the combined fleets of the powers, their fortune
on land was not as favorable. Turenne and Condé led the armies of
France to the soil of the Dutch Republic, and to mark his advantage, Louis
XIV. brought his court to Utrecht. A revolution in Holland was the immediate
consequence. The Grand Pensionary, who in his alarm sought peace,
lost the favor of the people, resigned his office, and was quickly murdered by
the excited followers of William of Orange. William, having demanded and
obtained appointment as Stadtholder, at once placed himself at the head of
the war party, and active hostilities were prosecuted by sea and land, both
far and near. Among the rumors which reached the inhabitants of the
New York province, whose kinsmen were again at war with each other,
was one to the effect that a Dutch squadron which had been despatched
against the West India colonies was on its way along the Atlantic coast.
Lovelace discredited the information, and seems to have made no immediate
efforts to strengthen the forts. Troops were called in, however, from the
river garrisons and the posts on the Delaware; but their number, with the
volunteers, reached only three hundred and thirty men. The alarm soon
subsiding, the new-comers were dismissed, and the garrison left in Fort James
did not exceed eighty men. Lovelace himself, in entire serenity of mind,
left the city on a visit to Governor Winthrop in Connecticut. The rumor,
however, proved true. The Dutch squadron, after capturing or destroying
the Virginia fleet of tobacco ships in the Chesapeake, sailed northward,
and on Aug. 7, 1673, anchored off Staten Island. Informed of the precise
state of the New York defences by the captain of a prize captured
at the mouth of James River, the Dutch commander made an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
demand for the surrender of the city. The Dutch fleet, commanded by
Evertsen, originally consisting of fifteen ships, had been reinforced in its
course by seven men-of-war, and with its prizes now numbered twenty-seven
sail, which carried sixteen hundred men. Against this force no resistance
was possible. On the morning of the 8th the fleet moved up
the bay, exchanged shots with the fort, and landed six hundred men on the
shore of the Hudson just above the city, where they were joined by a body
of the Dutch burghers. A storming party was advanced, under command
of Captain Anthony Colve, to whom Captain Manning, who commanded in
the Governor’s absence, surrendered the fort, the garrison being permitted
to march out with the honors of war. Thus New York was again surrendered
without the shedding of a drop of blood.</p>

<p>A few days later Lovelace, entrapped into a visit to the city, was first
courteously entertained, then arrested on a civil suit for debt and detained.
The river settlements of Esopus and Albany surrendered without opposition;
and those in the immediate neighborhood of the city, where the
Dutch population was in ascendency, made submission. The eastern
towns of Long Island, of English descent, came in with reluctance. The
commodores Evertsen and Binckes, who acted as council of war of New
Netherland, after confiscating the property of the Duke of York and of
his agent, by proclamation commissioned Captain Anthony Colve Governor-General
of the country, and set sail for Holland,&mdash;Binckes taking
Lovelace with him on his ship at his request.</p>

<p>New York had greatly changed in nine years of English rule. From
a sleepy Dutch settlement it had become the capital of a well-ordered
province. Colve, the new Dutch governor, went through the form of a
return to the old order of city government of the home pattern, and prepared
a provincial Instruction to which the outlying towns were to conform.
Massachusetts again asserted her old claim to run her southern line
to the Hudson, and Connecticut hankered once more after the fertile towns
of Long Island, settled by her sons. But Massachusetts had no disposition
to take up arms to restore the Duke of York to his possessions. The refusal
of the Duke to take the test oath of conformity to the Protestant religion
of the Established Church, and the leaning of Charles to the French
alliance, alarmed the Puritans, and Connecticut was content, by volunteer
reinforcements, to strengthen the eastern towns in their resistance to
Colve’s authority.</p>

<p>The news of the recapture of New York reached Holland in October,
when Joris Andringa was by the States-General appointed governor of New
Netherland under the instructions of the Board of Admiralty. Notwithstanding
the earnest request of the Dutch inhabitants of the reconquered
province and the petition of persons interested in its trade in the mother
country, the States-General recognized the impossibility of holding their
American possessions on the mainland, surrounded as they were by a growing
and aggressive English population. The Prince of Orange, with true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
statesmanship, saw that the only safety of the Republic was in a concentration
of resources in order to oppose the power of France. The offer of a
restitution of New Netherland was directly made to Charles II. as an evidence
of the desire for peace and a good understanding. Charles referred
the subject to Parliament, which instantly recommended acceptance, and
within three days a treaty was drawn up and signed at Westminster, which
once more and finally transferred the province of New York to the King
of Great Britain. Proclamation of the treaty was made at Guild Hall
early in July, 1674. The news came by way of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Connecticut determined to make one more push for the control
on Long Island of Southampton, Easthampton, and Southold, and petitions
were addressed to the King. At the same time she sought again to include
the territory between the boundary line established in 1664 and the Hudson.
And it may be stated as a curious instance of the politics of the time, that
some friend of Massachusetts, urged by her agent in London, actually contemplated
the purchase of the entire province of New York in her interest.</p>

<p>The new governor appointed by the King to receive the surrender of
the New Netherland was one Edmund Andros, major in a dragoon regiment.
In continuance of the liberal policy of 1664, all the inhabitants were
by his instructions confirmed in their rights and privileges, and in the
undisturbed possession of their property. By the treaty of Westminster,
the New Netherland, the rightful possession of which by the Dutch was
implied by its tenor, was ceded to the King. Although termed a restitution,
it was held that the rights of the Duke of York had been extinguished
by the conquest, and that restitution to the sovereign did not convey restoration
to the subject. The Duke of York, now better informed as to the
nature and value of the territory, on June 29, 1674, obtained from his
royal brother a new patent with enlarged authority. To Andros, who bore
the King’s authority to receive submission, the Duke now conferred his
commission to govern the province in his name. Lieutenant Anthony
Brockholls was named his successor in case of death. Andros was a
man of high character, well suited by nature and experience to carry out
the policy of his master,&mdash;the policy skilfully inaugurated by Nicolls and
loyally pursued by Lovelace,&mdash;the institution of an autocratic government
of the most arbitrary nature in form, but of extreme mildness in
practice; one which, insuring peace and happiness to the subject, would
best contribute to the authority and revenue of the master. Colonization
was encouraged, the customs burdens lightened, the laws equally administered,
and freedom of conscience secured. Although the Duke of York,
in his refusal to take the test oath prescribed by the Act of 1673, had proclaimed
himself an adherent of the Church of Rome, and Brockholls was
a professed Papist, and neither master nor servant could hold office in
England under that Act, and although the British American colonies were
not within its provisions, yet it does not appear that any effort was made
by the Church of Rome to exercise its religion under the guarantee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the King and of the Duke. There were doubtless few of that faith in the
Protestant colony of New York to claim the privilege. It was left to the
wise men who laid the foundations of the Empire State in 1777 to put
in practice the freedom of religion <i>to all</i>, which, strangely enough, was
first guaranteed in word by the Catholic prince.</p>

<p>The new patent of 1674 restored to the Duke his full authority over
the entire domain covered by the original grant, and brought New Jersey
again within his rule; yet he was persuaded to divest himself of this proprietorship
by a new release to Carteret. No grant of power to govern
being named in either the first or the second instrument, this authority was
held as reserved by the Duke. The cession was nevertheless of extreme
and lasting injury to the New York province, as it impaired its control over
the west bank of the mouth of the Hudson and the waters of the bay. On
the other hand, the Duke’s title to Long Island and Pemaquid was strengthened
by a release obtained from Lord Stirling; and the assumption of
Connecticut to govern the eastern towns in the former territory was summarily
disposed of. The Duke’s authority in Pemaquid, Martha’s Vineyard,
and Nantucket, though disturbed by some of the inhabitants who sought
to bring them under the government of Massachusetts, had been maintained
during the period of Colve’s administration. They had not been named in
the commission of the Dutch commanders to Colve. The claim of Connecticut
to the strip of land between the Mamaroneck line and the Hudson
River was disallowed by the Duke, and possession of the territory
entered by Connecticut was demanded by Andros. Connecticut held to
the letter of her charter; Andros to the letters-patent of the King. The
rising of the Narragansett tribes under King Philip afforded Andros an
opportunity to assert the Duke’s authority. Sailing with three sloops and
a body of soldiers, he landed at Saybrook, and read the Duke’s patent and
his own commission. The Connecticut officers replied by reading the protest
of the Hartford authorities. It is reasonable to suppose that had
Andros found the Saybrook fort unoccupied, he would have put in a
garrison to protect from the Indians the territory which he claimed to be
within his commission. Had he intended a surprise, he would not have
given notice to Winthrop that the object of his journey was “the Connecticut
River, his Royal Highness’s bounds there.” Neither Andros nor the
Connecticut authorities desired an armed collision. Andros, content with
the assertion of his claim, crossed the Sound, despatched aid to his dependencies
of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, and returned, after reviewing
the militia and disarming the Indians. The course of Andros was approved
by the Duke, who, while insisting on his claim to all the territory west of
the Connecticut River, ordered that the distance of twenty miles from the
Hudson be observed for the dividing line.</p>

<p>The northern frontier was also watched with jealous solicitude. The
increase of French influence through their missionaries now became the
occasion of an English policy of far-reaching significance,&mdash;a policy felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
throughout the American Revolution and in the later contest of the States
of the Union for Western territory. The friendship of the Mohawks, the
only tribe which did not acknowledge French supremacy, was encouraged.
Andros personally visited the stronghold of the Mohawks, and on his return
to Albany confirmed a close alliance with the Iroquois and organized a board
of Indian Commissioners. This sagacious plan served in the future as an
effectual check to the encroachments of the French. The ministers of
Louis XIV. were quick to feel the blow, and in 1677 the counter claim was
set up that the reception of the Jesuit missionaries had given sovereignty
to France over the Iroquois. The future contest which was to shake the
two continents was already foreshadowed. The same year the supremacy
of New York over the Iroquois was tacitly admitted by Massachusetts in
the treaty made with them “under the advice” of Andros.</p>

<p>In the details of his administration Andros showed the same firmness.
The old contraband trade with the Dutch was arrested; no European goods
were admitted from any port that had not paid duties in England. This
strict enforcement of the Navigation Laws diminished the coastwise trade
with Massachusetts and promoted a direct intercourse with England, which
gradually brought the province into close relation with the English commercial
towns. Social and political alliance was the natural result, and New
York grew gradually to be the most English in sentiment of the American
colonies, notwithstanding the cosmopolitan character of her population.</p>

<p>Increasing commerce requiring greater accommodation, a great mole
or dock was built on the East River, which afforded protection to vessels
in the rapid tide, and for a long period was the centre of the traffic of the
city of New York. The answer of Governor Andros to the inquiries of the
Council of Plantations as to the condition of the province gives the best
existing account of it in 1678. The following are the principal points:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Boundaries,&mdash;South, the Sea; West, Delaware; North, to ye Lakes or ffrench;
East, Connecticut river, but most usurped and yett posse’d by s’d Connecticut. Some
Islands Eastward and a Tract beyond Kennebeck River called Pemaquid.... Principall
places of Trade are New Yorke and South’ton except Albany for the Indyans; our
buildings most wood, some lately stone and brick; good country houses, and strong of
their severall kindes. About twenty-four towns, villages, or parishes in six precincts,
divisions, Rydeings, or Courts of Sessions. Produce is land provisions of all sorts, as
of wheate exported yearly about sixty thousand bushells, pease, beefe, pork, and some
Refuse fish, Tobacco, beavers’ peltry or furs from the Indians, Deale and oake timber,
plankes, pipestavves, lumber, horses, and pitch and tarr lately begunn to be made.
Comodityes imported are all sorts of English manufacture for Christians, and blanketts,
Duffells, etc., for Indians, about 50,000 pounds yearly. Pemaquid affords merchantable
fish and masts. Our merchants are not many, but most inhabitants and planters, about
two thousand able to beare armes, old inhabitants of the place or of England, Except
in and neere New Yorke of Dutch Extraction, and some few of all nations, but few
serv’ts much wanted, and but very few slaves. A merchant worth one thousand
pounds or five hundred pounds is accompted a good substantiall merchant, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>

England, and our own built, of which 5 small ships and a Ketch now belonging to

sorts,&mdash;one Church of England, several Presbyterians and Independents, Quakers
and Anabaptists of severall sects, some Jews, but Presbyterians and Independents
most numerous and substantial. There are about 20 churches or meeting-places, of
which about half vacant. Noe beggars, but all poor cared for.”</p>

<p class="p1">In 1678, the affairs of the province being everywhere in order, Andros
availed himself of the permission given him by the Duke to pay a visit to
England. He sailed from New York on the 12th of November, leaving
Brockholls to administer the government in his absence, with the commission
of commander-in-chief. On reaching London Andros was knighted by
the King. His administration was examined into by the Privy Council and
approved. In May he sailed for New York with the new commission of
vice-admiral throughout the government of the Duke of York. He found
the province in the same quiet as when he left it.</p>

<p>The marriage of William of Orange with Mary, daughter of the Duke
of York and heiress to the throne of England, in the autumn of 1677, was of
happy augury to the New York colony. It gave earnest of a restoration of
the natural alliance of the Protestant powers against France, the common
enemy. To the Dutch of New York it was peculiarly grateful, allaying the
last remains of the bitterness of submission to alien rule. Andros wisely
promoted this good feeling by interesting himself in the formal establishment
of their religion. Under his direction a classis of the Reformed
Church of Holland met in New York for purposes of ordination, and its
proceedings were approved by the supreme ecclesiastical authority at
Amsterdam. New points in law were now decided and settled; strikes or
combinations to raise the price of labor were declared illegal; all Indians
were declared to be free.</p>

<p>But Andros was on occasion as energetic and determined as he was
prudent and moderate. He dallied with no invasion of his master’s rights
or privileges, as he evinced when, in 1680, he arrested Carteret in New
Jersey and dragged him to trial<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> for having presumed to exercise jurisdiction
and collect duties within the limits of the Duke’s patent.</p>

<p>The position of the Duke of York now became daily more difficult, indeed
almost untenable in his increasing divergence from the policy of the kingdom.
The elements of that personal opposition which was later to drive
him from the throne were rapidly concentrating. His adherents and those
who favored a Protestant succession were forming the historic parties of
Tories and of Whigs. To avoid angry controversy the Duke ordered the
question of his right to collect customs dues in New Jersey to be submitted
to Sir William Jones. Upon his adverse decision so far as related to West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Jersey, the Duke directed the necessary transfer to be made; and when
the widow of Carteret made complaint of his dispossession from authority,
the action of Andros was wholly disavowed by the Duke, and his authority
over East Jersey was relinquished in the same form. Andros himself,
against whom complaints of favoring the Dutch trade had been made by
his enemies, was ordered to return to England, leaving Brockholls in charge
of the government; at the same time a special agent was sent over to
examine into the administration.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Conscious of the integrity of his service,
Andros obeyed the summons with alacrity, proclaimed the agent’s commission,
called Brockholls down from Albany to take charge of the government,
and took ship for England. The absence of his firm hand was
soon felt. The term for the levy of the customs rates under the Duke’s authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
had expired just before his sailing, and had not been renewed.
Immediately after his departure the merchants refused to pay duties, and
the collector who attempted the levy was held for high treason in the
exercise of regal authority without warrant. He pleaded his commission
from the Duke, and the case was referred to England. The resistance of the
merchants was stimulated by the free condition of the charter just granted
to Pennsylvania, which required that all laws should be assented to by the
freemen of the province, and that no taxes should be laid or revenue raised
except by provincial assembly. The Grand Jury of New York presented
the want of a provincial assembly as a grievance; a petition was drafted
to the Duke praying for a change in the form of government, and calling
for a governor, council, and assembly, the last to be elected by the freeholders
of the colony. On the arrival of the Duke’s agent in London with
his report upon the late administration, Andros was examined by the Duke’s
commissioners, whereupon he was fully exonerated, his administration was
complimented, and he was made a gentleman of the King’s Privy Chamber.
The Duke’s collector, after waiting in vain for his prosecutors to appear,
was discharged from his bond, and soon after appointed surveyor-general
of customs in the American Plantations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his dislike to popular assemblies, the Duke of York saw
the need of some concession, and gave notice of his intention to Brockholls.
Thus by the accident of the non-renewal of the customs’ term, the
people of New York were enabled, in the absence of the governor, to assert
the doctrine of no taxation without representation, to which the Duke in
his necessity was compelled to submit.</p>

<p>Great changes had taken place in the neighboring territory of New
Jersey, which the Duke had alienated from his original magnificent domain,
to its mutilation and lasting injury. Pennsylvania was formally organized
as a province, and Philadelphia was planned. East New Jersey passed into
the hands of twelve proprietors, who increased their number by sale to
twenty-four, selected a governor, summoned a legislature, and organized
the State.</p>

<p>While the English race, true to its instincts and traditions, was thus
organizing its settlements, bringing its population into homogeneity, and
preparing for a gradual but sure extension of its colonization from a firm,
well-ordered base, the more adventurous French were pushing their voyages
and posts along the lakes and down the Western streams, until the
discovery of the mouth of the Mississippi by La Salle completed the chain
and added to the nominal domain of the sovereign of France the vast
territory from the Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico, to which he gave the
name of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="p2">The governor selected by the Duke of York to succeed Andros and to
inaugurate the new order of government in his province was Colonel
Thomas Dongan, an Irish officer who had commanded a regiment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
French service. Though a Roman Catholic, an Irishman, and a soldier,
he proved himself an excellent and prudent magistrate. The instructions
of the Duke required the appointment of
a council of ten eminent citizens and the
issue of writs for a general assembly, not to
exceed eighteen, to consult with the Governor
and Council with regard to the laws
to be established, such laws to be subject to his approval,&mdash;the general
tenor of laws as to life and property to be in conformity with the common
law of England. No duties were to be levied except by the Assembly.
No allusion was made to religion. No more democratic form of government
existed in America, or was possible under kingly authority.</p>

</div>

<p>Dongan reached the city of New York, Aug. 28, 1683, and assumed
the government. Installing his secretary and providing occupation for
Brockholls, he summoned an assembly, and then hastened to Albany to
check the attempt of Penn to extend the bounds of the territory of Pennsylvania
by a purchase of the valley of the Upper Susquehanna from the
Iroquois, who claimed the country by right of conquest from the Andastes.
In this Dongan was successful; the Cayugas settling the question by a
formal conveyance of the coveted territory to the New York Government, a
cession which was later confirmed by the Mohawks. At the same time
this tribe was instructed as to their behavior toward the French. The
claim of New York to all the land on the south side of the lake was again
renewed and assented to by the Mohawks. The astute Iroquois already
recognized that only through the friendship of the English could their
independence be maintained.</p>

<p>The New York Assembly met in October. Its first act bore the title of
“The Charter of Liberties and Privileges granted by his Royal Highness to
the Inhabitants of New York and its dependencies.” The supreme legislative
authority, under the King and the Duke, was vested in a governor,
council, and “the people met in general assembly;” the sessions, triennial
as in England; franchise, free to every freeholder; the law, that of England
in its most liberal provisions; freedom of conscience and religion to all
peaceable persons “which profess faith in God by Jesus Christ.” In the
words of the petition of right of 1628, no tax or imposition was to be
laid except by act of Assembly,&mdash;in consideration of which privileges the
Assembly was to grant the Duke or his heirs certain specified impost
duties. The province was divided into twelve counties. Four tribunals
of justice were established; namely, town courts with monthly sessions for
the trial of petty cases; county or courts of sessions; a general court of
oyer and terminer, to meet twice in each year; and a court of chancery
or supreme court of the province, composed of the Governor and Council.
An appeal to the King was reserved in every case. In addition to these
there was a clause unusual in American statutes, naturalizing the foreign
born residents and those who should come to reside within the limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the province, which had already assumed the cosmopolitan character
which has never since ceased to mark the city of New York. The liberal
provisions of the statute gave security to all, and invited immigration
from Europe, where religious intoleration was again unsettling the bases
of society. It was not until the 4th of October, 1684, that the Duke
signed and sealed the amended instrument, “The Charter of Franchises
and Privileges to New Yorke in America,” and ordered it to be registered
and sent across sea.</p>

<p>Connecticut making complaint of the extension of New York law over
the territory within the contested boundary lines, Dongan brought the long
dispute to a summary close by giving notice to the Hartford authorities
that unless they withdrew their claims to territory within twenty miles of
the Hudson he should renew the old New York claim to the Connecticut
River as the eastern limit of the Duke’s patent, and refer the subject directly
to his Highness. In reply to an invitation from Dongan, commissioners
proceeded from Hartford to New York, who abandoned the pretensions set
up, and accepted the line proposed by Dongan, thus finally closing the
controversy.</p>

<p>The city of New York was now divided into six wards, certain jurisdiction
conferred upon its officers, and a recorder was appointed.</p>

<p>Dongan with the vision of a statesman recognized the value of the friendship
of the Indians. The Iroquois tribes he described as the bulwark of New
York against Canada. The policy of the Duke’s governors from the time
of Nicolls was unchanged. It consisted in a claim to all the territory south
and southwest of the Lake of Canada (Ontario), and the confining of
the French to the territory to the northward by the help of Indian allies.
The French officers by negotiation and threat endeavored first to impose
their authority on the several tribes of the Iroquois confederacy, and failing
in this to divide them. But Dongan, carefully observing their manœuvres,
obtained from a council of chiefs a written submission to the King of
England, which was recorded on two white dressed deer-skins. The presence
on the occasion at Albany of Lord Howard of Effingham, the Governor
of Virginia, added greatly in the eyes of the Indians to this solemn
engagement. Four nations bound themselves to the covenant, and asked
that the arms of the Duke of York should be put upon their castles; and
Dongan gave notice of the same to the Canadian Government, in witness
that they were within his jurisdiction and under his protection. But in
this submission the Indians recognized no subjection. The Iroquois still
claimed his perfect freedom.</p>

<p>The claim of Massachusetts to territory westward of the Hudson was
another perplexing element in the Indian question. In answer to a renewal
of this demand, Dongan set up his claim as the Duke’s governor
to jurisdiction over the towns which Massachusetts had organized on land
covered by the Duke’s patent on the west side of the Connecticut River;
but the matter being soon disposed of by the cancelling, for various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
offences, of the Massachusetts patent by the King, through the operation
of a writ of <i>quo warranto</i>, the Duke had no further contestant to his
claims. The New Jersey boundary was also matter of dispute, but Dongan,
at first of his own motion, and later by specific instruction from the
Duke, took care to prevent Penn from acquiring any part of New Jersey
or from interfering with the Indian trade.</p>

<p>The controversy with Canada as to the country south of the St. Lawrence
and Lake Ontario now drew to a head. Dongan clung persistently to the
claim asserted by Andros in 1677. Against this the Canadians set up the
sovereignty of France, acquired by war and treaties and the planting of
missionaries among the tribes. The question turned upon the independence
of the Iroquois, parts of which tribes had never made submission, or
had repudiated the interpretation set upon their engagements. The new
French governor, De la Barre, made ineffectual menace, but not supporting
his threat with arms, lost the respect of the savages. The prestige of
the English was increased, and the coveted trade passed into their hands to
such an extent that in 1684 the Senecas alone brought into Albany more
than ten thousand beaver skins. Nor was Denonville, who succeeded De la
Barre in the government of Canada, more fortunate in enforcing his policy.
His wily effort to engage the sympathies of his co-religionist Dongan in a
support of the French missionaries among the tribes, was foiled by the New
York governor, who at the same time secured the approbation of his Roman
Catholic master by proposing to replace them with English priests.</p>

<p class="p2">The death of Charles II., early in the year 1685, and the accession
to the throne of the Duke of York as James II., were of momentous
influence upon European politics. They at once changed the political
position of New York. The condition of proprietorship or nominal duchy
altered with that of its master and proprietor. The Duke became a King;
the duchy a royal province. The change involved a change in the New
York charter, and afforded opportunity for a reconsideration and rejection
of the entire instrument. The words “the people” were particularly
objected to by the new King as unusual. The revocation of the Massachusetts
charter by the late King, the government of which colony had not yet
been settled, presented a favorable occasion for an assimilation of all the
constitutions of the American colonies as preliminary to that consolidation
of government and power at which James aimed as his ideal of government.
Nevertheless the existing New York charter remained,&mdash;not confirmed, not
repealed, but continued. The Scotch risings and the Monmouth rebellion
interfered with any immediate action by the Government in American affairs.
Yet the New York province hailed with joy the accession of their Duke
and Lord proprietor to the throne. His rule had been just and temperate;
his agents prudent and discreet. The immediate Governor, Dongan, was
thoroughly identified with the interests of the province confided to his
care, and aimed to make of its capital the centre of English influence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
America. In 1686 the city received a new charter, with a grant of all the
vacant land in and about the city. Albany, also, under an arrangement
with the landed proprietors, was incorporated and intrusted with the management
of the Indian trade. The suppression of the Monmouth rebellion
enabling James to turn his attention to America, he directed proceedings
to be instituted in the English courts to cancel the charters of the Connecticut,
Rhode Island, West Jersey, and Delaware colonies. In the interim
a temporary government was established for Massachusetts, Plymouth,
Maine, and New Hampshire, in accordance with the order of Charles
made in 1684. A board of councillors was appointed, of whom Joseph
Dudley was named president.</p>

<p>Weary of the trouble and expense of maintaining authority in distant
Pemaquid, Dongan urged the King to annex this dependency to Massachusetts,
and to add Connecticut to New York. Dudley pleaded the claim
of Massachusetts with the Connecticut authorities. They held an even
balance between the two demands, however, and resolved to maintain the
autonomy of the colony, if possible, against either the machinations of her
neighbors or the warrant of the King.</p>

<p>It has been seen that as Duke of York the policy of James in the government
of his American province was, with the exception of the weakness
shown in the case of Carteret and New Jersey, the consolidation of power.
His accession to the throne enabled him to carry out this policy on a
broader field. He determined to put an end to the temporary charge by
commissioners of the New England colonies, and to unite them all under
one government, the better to defend themselves against invasion. The
assigned reason was the policy of aggression of the French on the frontiers.
The person selected for the delicate duty of harmonizing the colonies into
one province was Sir Edmund Andros, who, as the Duke’s deputy, had first
suggested that a strong royal government should be established in New
England, and of whose character and administrative abilities there was
no question. He was accordingly commissioned by the King “Captain-General
and Governor-in-Chief over his territory and dominions of New
England in America.” By the terms of his instructions, liberty of conscience
was granted to all, countenance promised to the Church of England,
and power conferred on the Assembly to make laws and levy taxes. Pemaquid
was annexed to the new government.</p>

<p>To assimilate the New York government to that of the new dominion
a new commission was issued to Dongan as King’s captain-general and
governor-in-chief over the province of New York. The charter of liberties
and privileges recently signed was repealed; the existing laws, however,
were to continue in force until others should be framed and promulgated
by the Governor and Council. The liberty of conscience granted in 1674
and limited in 1683 to Christians, was now extended to all persons without
restriction. A censorship of the press was established. The trade of the
Hudson River was to be kept free from intrusion by any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>While the King was thus strengthening his power and gathering into
one grasp the entire force of the colonies, his ministers allowed themselves
to be outwitted by the French in negotiation. A treaty of neutrality inspired
by France engaged non-interference by either Government in the
wars of the other against the savage tribes in America, and struck a severe
blow at the policy of the New York governors. The announcement of the
treaty was accompanied by the arrival of reinforcements in Canada and the
organization of an expedition against the Iroquois. The treacherous seizure
and despatch to France of a number of chiefs, who had been invited
to a conference at Quebec, opened the campaign, at once ended the
French missions among the Five Nations, and consolidated their alliance
with the English. The expedition of Denonville was partially successful.
The Seneca country was occupied, sovereignty proclaimed, and a fort built
on the old site of La Salle’s Fort de Conty. But the power of the Iroquois
was not touched. Hampered by his instructions, Dongan could only
lay the situation before the King and suggest a comprehensive plan for the
fortification of the country and assistance of the friendly tribes. Alarmed
at the news from the frontier, he resolved to winter in Albany, and ordered
the Five Nations to send their old women and children to Catskill, where
they could be protected and cared for. A draft was also made of every
tenth militia man to strengthen the Albany post. Denonville, despairing
of conquering the fierce Iroquois, though they were supported only by the
tacit aid of the English, now urged upon Louis XIV. the acquisition of the
coveted territory by exchange or by purchase, even of the entire province
of New York, with the harbor of the city.</p>

<p>Dongan’s messenger to James easily satisfied the King that the treaty of
neutrality was not for the interest of England, and that if the independence
of the Five Nations were not maintained, the sovereignty over them must be
English. Orders were sent to Dongan to defend and protect them, and to
Andros and the other governors to give them aid. To the complaints of
Louis, James opposed the submission made at Albany in 1684 by the chiefs
in the presence of the Governor of Virginia. As a compromise between
the Governments it was agreed by treaty that until January, 1689, no act of
hostility should be committed or either territory invaded. The warlike
defensive operations against the French put the New York Government to
extraordinary charges, amounting to more than £8,000, to which the neighboring
colonies were invited to contribute under authority of the King’s
letter of November, 1687. The occasion to urge the importance of New
York as the bulwark of the colonies, and of strengthening her by the
annexation of Connecticut and New Jersey, was not forgotten by the sagacious
Dongan. Now that the Dutch pretension to rule in America was
definitively set at rest, it was evident to statesmen that a struggle for the
American continent would sooner or later arise between the powers of
France and England,&mdash;indeed the rivalry had already begun. To James,
who thoroughly understood the practice as well as the theory of administration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and was as diligent in his cabinet as any of his ministers, it was
equally evident that the consolidated power of New France in the single
hand of a viceroy was more serviceable than the discordant action of
provinces so much at variance with each other in principle and feeling as
the American colonies. To the viceregal government of New France he
resolved to oppose a viceregal government of British America. To New
England he now determined to annex New York. Dongan was recalled,
gratified with military promotion and personal honor, and Sir Edmund
Andros was commissioned governor-general of the entire territory. His
commission gave him authority over</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“All that tract of land, circuit, continent, precincts, and limits in America lying
and being in breadth from forty degrees of northern latitude from the equinoctial line
to the River St. Croix eastward, and from thence directly northward to the River of
Canada, and in length and longitude by all the breadth aforesaid throughout the main
land, from the Atlantic or Western Sea or Ocean on the east part to the South Sea on
the west part, with all the islands, seas, rivers, waters, rights, members, and appurtenances
thereunto belonging (our province of Pennsylvania and country of Delaware
only excepted), to be called and known, as formerly, by the name and title of our
territory and dominion of New England in America.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 11th of August, 1688, Andros assumed his viceregal authority at
Fort James in New York. A few days later the news arrived of the birth
of a son to King James. A proclamation of the viceroy ordered a day of
thanksgiving to be observed within the city of New York and dependencies.
Thus New York was formally recognized as the metropolis and the seat of
government in the Dominion of New England. By the King’s instructions
the seal of New York was broken in council, and the great seal of New
England thereafter used.</p>

<p>The Governor of Canada was notified that the Five Nations were the
subjects of the King of England, and would be protected as such. The
new governor visited Albany, and held a conference with the delegates from
the Five Nations, and renewed the old covenant of Corlaer. The Indians
showing signs of restlessness all along the frontier as far as Casco Bay, the
viceroy endeavored to settle the difficulties between Canada and the New
York tribes, and engaged his good offices to secure the return of the
prisoners from France. On his return to Boston Andros left the affairs of
the New York government in the charge of Nicholson. Dongan retired to
his farm at Hempstead on Long Island. Though peaceful, the new dominion
was not at rest. The liberty of conscience declared by the King was
not precisely that which each dissenting denomination desired. Gradually
men of each grew to believe that James was indifferent to all religions that
were not of the true faith; and regarding the simple manner in which by
legal form he had stripped them of their chartered rights, began to fear
that by an act as legal he might strip them of their liberty of worship. The
test Act which he had refused to obey, to the loss of his dignities and honors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
as Duke, might be altered to the ruin of its authors. A Roman Catholic
test might take the place of the Protestant form. The King reigned, and
a son was born to him, who doubtless would be educated in the papist
faith of the Stuarts. William of Orange was only near the throne.</p>

</div></div>

<p>While the colonies were thus agitated, a spirit of quiet resistance was
spreading in England, where alarm was great at the arbitrary manner in
which charters were stricken down. Property was threatened. In the
American colonies the agitation was chiefly religious. Among their
inhabitants were Huguenot families whom the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes in 1685 had ruthlessly driven from their homes to a shelter
on the distant continent. The crisis was at hand. Strangely enough, it
was precipitated by the declaration of liberty of conscience and the abrogation
of the test oath against Dissenters which King James had commissioned
Andros to proclaim in America. This liberty of conscience included
liberty to Catholics, which the Protestants would have none of. The abrogation
of the test oath opened the way to preferment and honor to Catholics,
which the Protestants were equally averse to. Ordered to read the proclamation
in the churches, seven bishops, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
refused to obey the command. The prelates were committed, tried,
and acquitted. Encouraged by this victory, the great Whig houses of
England now addressed an invitation to William of Orange, who was already,
with naval and military force, secretly prepared to cross the sea. On the
5th of November the great Stadtholder landed on the shores of Devon, and
proclaimed himself the maintainer of English liberties. Thus a declaration
of liberty of conscience brought about the fall of a Catholic king. The
news caused great excitement in the colonies.</p>

<p>Andros, who had but lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
returned to Boston from an expedition to the northeastern frontier of
Maine, where he had established posts for protection against the tribes
who were threatening a second Indian war, was seized and imprisoned by
a popular uprising. In New York the agitation was as intense. Nicholson,
the lieutenant-governor,
unequal to the emergency,
let slip the grasp of power
from his hand; and on the
open revolt of Leisler, one
of the militia captains, who
seized the fort, he determined to sail for England, and the control of the
province passed to a committee of safety. The revolt of Leisler forms the
opening of a new chapter in the story of the New York province.</p>

<h3><a name="c411" id="c411">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE are several comprehensive general histories of what is now the State of New
York. The first edition<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> of Smith’s History was dedicated to the Earl of Halifax,
First Lord Commissioner of Trade and Plantations. The dedication bears date New York,
June 15, 1756. It is illustrated with a folding frontispiece plate, entitled “The South View
of Oswego on Lake Ontario.” In his Preface the author states that his researches while
engaged under appointment of the New York Assembly in a review and digest of the laws
of the province, a work in which he was associated with William Livingston, induced the
preparation of this the first History of the colony. He excuses himself from an attention
to details, which he considered would not interest the British public, and declares his purpose
to confine himself to a “summary account of the first rise and present state” of
the colony. He presents it as a “narrative or thread of simple facts,” rather than as a
history.</p>

<p>A second edition of this work appeared at London in 1776, from the press of J. Almon.
It is a reprint in an octavo volume of three hundred and thirty-four pages. The troubles
with the colonies and the important position of New York as the headquarters of the
British army no doubt prompted this venture.</p>

<p>An American edition next appeared, in April, 1792, from the press of Mathew Carey,
at Philadelphia, in an octavo volume of two hundred and seventy-six pages. It was announced
“to the citizens of the United States as the first part of a plan undertaken at the
desire of several gentlemen of taste, who wish to supply their libraries with histories of
their native country.” The titlepage describes it as “The Second Edition,” Almon’s
reprint having been ignored by Carey. The copy in the Library of the New York
Historical Society is illustrated with a “Frontispiece View of Columbia College, in the
City of New York,” from the plate originally engraved for the <i>New York Magazine</i> of
1790.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Another edition appeared at Albany, from the press of Ryer Schermerhorn, in 1814,
an octavo volume of five hundred and twelve pages. The anonymous editor, supposed
to have been Mr. J. V. N. Yates, states in his Advertisement, that in “copying Smith’s
History few deviations from his mode of spelling the names of places, particularly such
as are derived from the aboriginal tongues, have been made. It is believed that he [Smith]
adopted the mode of spelling which conveyed most clearly the sound of Indian words.”
Mr. Yates intended to add a “Continuation from the year 1732 to the commencement of
the year 1814,” but these additions stopped at 1747.</p>

<p>A French translation of Smith’s History, by M. Eidous, appeared in Paris in 1767,
and bears the imprint “Londres.” It is a duodecimo of four hundred and fifteen
pages.</p>

<p>Smith, the historian, who died Chief-Justice of Canada, left behind him a continuation
of his <i>History of New York</i>, written by his own hand. It covers the period from 1732 to
1762. This interesting manuscript was communicated to the New York Historical Society
in 1824 by William Smith, son of the author, then a distinguished member of the King’s
Council in Canada, and also well known as the author of the History of that province. In
his note to the Society, Mr. Smith states that “the Continuation of the History is as it was
left by the author, with only a few verbal alterations and corrections.” The manuscript
appeared in print for the first time in 1826, as the fourth volume of the <i>Collections</i> of the
New York Historical Society, an octavo of three hundred and eight pages. Copies of
Smith’s original volume having become rare, the Society determined to reprint it from the
author’s corrected and revised copy in a form similar to that in which they had published
the Continuation, and in 1829 the work appeared complete for the first time. It was
accompanied by a memoir of the author, written by his son. In making up sets of the
Society’s <i>Collections</i>, the complete work is generally bound as vols. iv. and v. of the
first series.</p>

<p>The next year, 1830, the Society issued a second edition of the complete work: also an
octavo in two volumes, but printed in larger type and on better paper. This edition bears
the press-mark of “Gratton, Printer.” Interesting sketches of the historian, with notices of
his family, prepared by Mr. Maturin L. Delafield, appeared in the <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, April and June, 1881. A small edition was struck off for Mr. Delafield for
private distribution, illustrated with portraits.</p>

<p>Several criticisms on Smith’s History have appeared in print: “Remarks on Smith’s
History of New York, London Edition, 1757, in Letters to John Pintard, Secretary of the
New York Historical Society, by Judge Samuel Jones,” written in 1817 and 1818, were
printed in the <i>Collections</i> of the New York Historical Society, vol. iii., 1821; “Correspondence
between Lieutenant-Governor Cadwallader Colden and William Smith, Jr., the
Historian, respecting certain alleged Errors and Misstatements contained in the <i>History of
New York</i>, with sundry other Papers relating to that Controversy,” printed in the <i>N. Y.
Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> (second series, vol. ii., 1849); “Letters on Smith’s History of New York,
by Cadwallader Colden,” printed in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> (Fund series), in 1868;
“Letter of Cadwallader Colden on Smith’s History, July 5th, 1759,” <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc.
Coll.</i> (Fund series), 1869.</p>

<p>The late Hon. Benjamin F. Butler, of New York, in an able discourse before the
Albany Institute, April, 1830, gives a fair and impartial estimate of the value of Smith’s
History. He notices the incomplete and summary manner in which the earlier period
was disposed of and ascribes it to the insufficient information within the reach of the
author and his want of acquaintance with the Dutch language, in which the ancient
records of the colony were written.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> The posthumous work he condemns as “written
in the spirit of a partisan,” and therefore to be received with caution, if not distrust.
Yet he freely acknowledges the deep indebtedness of the State and of the friends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
learning for the mass of authentic information discovered by him. With this judgment
scholars generally concur. In reading the pages of this the first of the historians
of New York, it must be borne in mind that Smith was one of the leaders of the Dissenting
element in the New York colony, and at a time when religious partisanship was
at its height.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>The second general history of New York was that of Macauley.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Its first volume
treats “of the extent of the State, its mountains, hills, champaigns, plains, vales, valleys,
marshes, rivers, creeks, lakes, seas, bays, springs, cataracts, and canals; its climate,
winds, zoology,” etc. The second, “of the counties, cities, towns, and villages; antiquities
of the west; origin of the Agoneaseah, their manners, customs, laws, and other
matters; discovery of America; voyages of Cabot and Hudson; settlements of the New
Netherlands by the Dutch in 1614; location of the Indian tribes; controversies between
the Dutch and English; surrender in 1664, and thence to 1750.” The third volume
covers “the war between England and France for the conquest of Canada, the war of
the Revolution, and other matters which occurred, etc.” The leaning of the author is,
as these words imply, essentially towards the physical features of the State. He himself
calls it a compendium, or abridged history. The reader will find little original matter of
an historical nature.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>The author of the next general history of the State<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> is well known as the historian of
the American Theatre and of the Arts of Design in America, both commendable works.
With the taste of an antiquary, Mr. Dunlap has gathered some curious details; but <i>The
History of the New Netherlands</i>, etc., has little merit as historical authority. The first
volume passed through the press during the fatal illness of the author; the second was
supervised by a friend who apologized for his want of “intimacy with the subject.” It appeared
after the author’s death. The main value of the work consists in the abstracts
published as an appendix to the second volume.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>A much more thorough work followed, a dozen years later, when Mr. Brodhead began
his History.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Its two volumes comprise all the known information concerning the period
they cover, up to the time of publication. Mr. Brodhead by birth and education was
eminently qualified for his ponderous task. He united in his blood the English and
Dutch strains; on the father’s side being descended from one of the English officers,
who came out with Nicolls at the time of the conquest. A lawyer by profession, he was
attached to the legation at the Hague, and was commissioned by the State of New York to
procure original materials relating to its early history. In this labor he spent three years
in the archives of England, Holland, and France. At his death he left manuscript material
for a third volume, which it is the hope of students may yet be made accessible.
He divides his work into four marked periods: The first, from the discovery, in 1609, to
its conquest by the English in 1664; the second carries the story down to 1691. The
treatment is of the most exhaustive character, and the work is a monument of literary
industry and careful execution. The authorities are in all cases given in foot-notes.
The sympathies of the author are plainly with Holland in the original struggle, and later
with New York in her occasional antagonism to the influence of New England. While
the reader may sometimes smile at his enthusiasm and differ from his opinions, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
find no occasion to quarrel with his candor. The tendency of his mind will be found
legal rather than judicial. His chief merit is his admirable co-ordination of an immense
mass of material, covering a vast circuit of investigation.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Specific Authorities.</span>&mdash;More particular
mention of such sources as pertain
jointly to the Dutch and English rule in New
York is made in Mr. Fernow’s chapter on “New
Netherland,” in Vol. IV.</p>

<p>Chalmers’ <i>Political Annals of the Present
United Provinces</i> reviews the English rule; but
Brodhead (i. 62) considers that Chalmers’s treatment
is biased, and grossly misrepresents the
facts.</p>

<p>The documents in Hazard’s <i>Historical Collections
of State Papers</i> which relate to New York
were reprinted in 1811 in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc.
Coll.</i>, i. 189-303, and in the printed series published
by the State under the editing of Dr.
O’Callaghan, an account of which can better be
made, unbroken between the Dutch and English
portions, in connection with Mr. Fernow’s
chapter. Various papers of importance, however,
have appeared in the <i>Collections</i> and <i>Proceedings</i>
of the New York Historical Society, and
others are in the <i>Manual of the City of New
York</i>, edited for thirty years, since 1841, successively
by Valentine and Shannon. The journals
of the Council and Assembly of the Colony of
New York are rich in material.</p>

<p>Some original documents have appeared in
connection with inquiries into the history of the
boundaries of the State: <i>Report to ascertain and
settle the Boundary Line between New York and
Connecticut</i>, Feb. 8, 1861; <i>Report on the Boundaries
of New York</i>, Albany, 1874; papers of
Dawson, Whitehead, etc., in <i>Historical Magazine</i>,

the conquest was made, is given in Brodhead’s
<i>New York</i>, ii. 651; cf. also Learning and
Spicer’s <i>Grants, etc. of New Jersey</i>, p. 3, and <i>New
York Colonial Documents</i>, ii. 295. Charles E.
Anthon, in the <i>Magazine of American History</i>, September,

New York city, in <i>Magazine of American History</i>,
1882. The <i>Manual</i> published successively by
Valentine and Shannon preserves much information
regarding the city’s history. Cf. General
De Peyster on “New York and its History,”
in <i>International Review</i>, April, 1878, and Mrs.
Lamb’s <i>History of New York City</i>, and other
local monographs, of which further mention is
made in the notes to Mr. Fernow’s chapter, in
Vol. IV.</p>

<p>The English occupation of New York was
confirmed by the Treaty of Breda, July 31, 1667.
The original Latin and Dutch of its text appeared
at the Hague in 1667. (Muller, <i>Books on America</i>,
1872, p. 119; Stevens, <i>Historical Collections</i>, vol. i.
no. 31.) A contemporary engraving of the signing
is in the <i>Kort en bondigh Verhael</i>, Amsterdam,
1667. (Stevens, no. 1079; Muller, <i>Books on America</i>,
1877, nos. 1697, 2268.) There was a French
edition published at Amsterdam in 1668. (<i>Recueil
van de Tractaten</i>, Hague, 1684).</p>

<p>The Dutch bibliographies refer to scores of
pamphlets launched against Sir George Downing,
the English diplomat who is charged with
instigating the war with England (1663-67), and
not infrequently assigning his animosity towards
the Dutch to feelings engendered in his early
New England home, Downing being a nephew
of Governor Winthrop, and a graduate of Harvard
College. (Sibley’s <i>Harvard Graduates</i>, i.
28, with a list of authorities, p. 51, and the
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 959, 975. Cf. on
Downing’s agency, O’Callaghan’s <i>New Netherland</i>,
ii. 515; Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>; Brodhead’s
<i>New York</i> and his <i>Colonial Documents
of New York</i>; and R. C. Winthrop’s paper in
5 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i> vol. i.)</p>

<p>On the Dutch side, Aitzema’s <i>Historie van
Saken van Staet en Oorlogh</i>, 1621-1668, Hague,
1657-1671, is a vast repository of documentary
evidence, vol. iv. covering Downing’s period,
and vol. vi. giving the negotiations of Breda.
The best edition, with a supplement by Sylvius,
was published in eleven volumes in 1669-1699.
(Muller, <i>Books on America</i>, 1877, no. 47.) Sabin,
<i>Dictionary</i>, v. 20,783, etc., gives various titles of
Downingiana, and a full list of Downing’s works
is given by Sibley, <i>Harvard Graduates</i>, i. 48. The
Dutch also charged upon Downing the initiative
in “curbing the progress and reducing the
power” of their State through the Navigation
Acts of 1651 and 1660; cf. Upham, in <i>Hunt’s
Merchants’ Magazine</i>, iv. 407.</p>

<p>The relations of the new English province
with the French and Indians are particularly
illustrated in the papers relating to De Courcelles
and De Tracy’s expedition against the Mohawks
(1665), published in the <i>Documentary History
of New York</i>, vol. i., where will also be found
the documents concerning Denonville’s expedition
against the Senecas and into the Genesee
country in 1687. Cf. also the narrative of Denonville
with O. H. Marshall’s notes, in 2 <i>N.
Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. 149. For the expedition
against Schenectady, 1689-90, see <i>N. Y. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, 1846, p. 137; cf. <i>Historical Magazine</i>,
xiii. 263, by J. G. Shea. A further treatment of
the French and Indian wars is made in Vol. IV.</p>

<p>The Hon. Henry C. Murphy found in Holland
the <i>Relation de sa Captivité parmi les Onneiouts en
1690-91</i>, by Father Millet, the Jesuit, and it was
edited by Mr. Shea in New York in 1864. Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 1063, says that with the
narrative of Jogues it gives us nearly all we
know from personal observation of the Five Nations
at this time. Further references to the literature
of the aboriginal occupation will be given
in Mr. Fernow’s chapter.</p>

<p>Regarding the seals of the province, see
<i>Documentary History of New York</i>, vol. iv., for
various engravings. (Cf. <i>Historical Magazine</i>, ix.
177, and Valentine’s <i>Manual</i>, 1851.) Reports on
the Province, 1668-1678, are in the <i>Documentary
History of New York</i>, vol. i.; and in vol. iii. the
papers on Manning’s surrender in 1673, and the
subsequent restoration.</p>

special treatments by R. H. Clarke in the <i>Catholic
World</i>, ix. 767, and by P. F. Dealy, S. J., in
<i>Magazine of American History</i>, February, 1882, p.
106. Dongan’s report on the state of the province,
1687, is in the <i>Documentary History of New
York</i>, vol. i. A view of his house is given in
Lamb’s <i>New York</i>, i. 326.</p>

<p>Upon Andros’s rule, compare the general
historians, and <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, vol.

<p>Something will be said of the more specific
local histories, covering both the Dutch and
English periods, in connection with Mr. Fernow’s
chapter in Vol. IV.</p>

<p>The news of the movements in the province,
both under the Dutch and English rule, as it
reached Europe, is recorded in <i>De Hollandsche
Mercurius</i>, 1650-1690, a periodical. Cf. Asher’s
<i>Essay</i>, p. 220; Muller’s <i>Catalogue</i> (1872), p. 104

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Views, Maps, and Descriptions of
New York and the Province under English
Rule.</span>&mdash;<i>Views.</i> The earliest views of
New Amsterdam date back to the Dutch period,
the first being that in the <i>Beschrijvinghe van
Virginia</i>, etc., 1651, of which a fac-simile is
given on the title of Asher’s <i>List of Maps</i>, Amsterdam,
1851, and in the <i>Popular History of the
United States</i>. The next appeared on the several
maps issued by N. J. Visscher, Van der
Donck, Allard (first map), Nicolas Visscher
(first map), and Danckers. It is seen in the
heliotype of Van der Donck’s map given in
Vol. IV., and in the engraving of the Visscher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
map, in Asher’s <i>List</i>.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> A view very like this is that given
on p. 124 of Arnoldus Montanus’s <i>De Nieuwe en Onbekende
Weereld of Beschryving van America</i>, a sumptuous folio
printed at Amsterdam, 1671, and at present variously priced
from $5 to $20. Cf. <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 1,066, with
fac-simile of title.</p>

<p>The same picture is reproduced in the later, 1673,
edition of Montanus, p. 143, and in Ogilby’s <i>America</i>,
1671, p. 171, where the description also follows Montanus,
with aid from Denton. (<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 1,067,
1,092.) Montanus’s account is translated in the <i>Documentary
History of New York</i>, iv. 75, 116, with a fac-simile
of the view in question. Cf. also Gay’s <i>Popular History
of the United States</i>, iii. 1, and the fac-simile issued, with
descriptive notes, by J. W. Moulton in 1825 as <i>New York
One Hundred and Seventy Years Ago</i>; and Watson’s <i>Olden
Times in New York</i>, 1832.</p>

<p>The picture is also given in fac-simile in Mr. Lenox’s
edition of Jogues’s <i>Novum Belgium</i>, edited by J. G. Shea,
and in <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, July, 1882, with a
paper by J. R. Stanwood on the settlement of New Netherland.
Muller, of Amsterdam in one of his catalogues, of
recent years, offered for 250 marks a water-color drawing
made in 1650, which he claimed as the original sketch
upon which the engraver in Montanus worked. Muller,
<i>Catalogue of American Portraits</i>, etc., no. 305. This view is
now in the New York Historical Society’s Library. It is
inscribed “In ‘t schip Lydia door Laurens Harmen Z<sup>n</sup>
Block, A<sup>o</sup> 1650.” There is no record of any ship of such
name arriving at New Amsterdam, and this together with
certain changes in the picture, as compared with Montanus,
have led good judges to suspect that it is a copy of that
view, by one who was never in New Amsterdam, rather
than its original. The paper and frame are old, at all
events.</p>

<p>A view purporting to represent the town in 1667 is
given in Valentine’s <i>New York City Manual</i>, 1851, p. 131,
and in his <i>History of New York City</i>, p. 71.</p>

<p>The view is inscribed: “Nieuw-Amsterdam,
onlangs Nieuw jorck genamt, ende hernomen bij
de Nederlanders op den 24 Aug., 1673, eindelijk
aan de Engelse weder afgestaan.” It took the
place of the engraved view, already mentioned
as appearing in the first edition of Allard’s map,
and was probably etched by Romeyn de Hooghe,
a distinguished artist of the day, when Hugo
Allard retouched his old plate to produce an
engraved map to meet the interest raised by the
recapture of the town. It also did service in the
later issues of the same plate by Carolus Allard
and the Ottens, and was reproduced in an inferior
way by Lotter on his map. See Asher’s <i>List
of Maps and Views</i>, p. 20. A view of 1679 is
given on a later page, with its history.</p>

<p>The annexed cut of the Strand follows a view

Jacob Leisler, and had been built by his father-in-law,
Vanderveen; cf. the narrative in the <i>Manual</i>.
It is also engraved in Gay’s <i>Popular History
of the United States</i>, iii. 14. Other houses of this
period are shown in the <i>Manual</i>, 1847, p. 371,

<p><i>Maps.</i> An account of the maps of the Dutch
period is given in Vol. IV. For the English
period, the earliest of the town of New York was
probably that supposed to have been sent home
by Nicoll (1664-68) after his occupation, and of
which a portion is herewith given.</p>

<p>Of about the same date is the original of the
Hudson River Map (1666), which will be found
in the next volume. Then came the map of the
province by Nicolas Visscher, issued in the first
edition of his <i>Atlas Minor</i> about 1670.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Not far
from the same time (1671) appeared the map
which is common to Montanus’s <i>Nieuwe en Onbekende
Weereld</i> and to Ogilby’s great folio <i>America</i>,
which shows the coast from the Penobscot
to the Chesapeake, and is entitled “Novi Belgii,
etc., delineatio.” It closely resembles Jansson’s
earlier map. The Allard map of 1673, from
which our engraved view is taken, was the second
by that cartographer of New Netherland, who
retouched the plate of the earlier one, which had
been mainly a reproduction of N. J. Visscher’s,
as the later one of Schenk and Valch (1690) was.
Asher says (nos. 13, 15, 16) that Allard in this
second map confined his additions to new names
in the Dutch regions. The same plate was later
used by Carolus Allard, and as late as 1740-50
by Ottens.</p>

<p>About 1680, in Danckers’ Atlas, published
at Amsterdam, is found a map, “Novi Belgii,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
etc., tabula, multis in locis emendata a J. Danckers,”
which, however, in Asher’s opinion was but
a revamping of the earlier Visscher plate.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The
map which N. J. Visscher published about 1640
was reissued about 1690 by Nicolas Visscher,
“Novi Belgii, etc., tabula, multis in locis emendata,”
making use of the work of Montanus and
Allard, of which there were also later issues.
(Asher’s <i>List</i>, no. 14; Muller, no. 2,276.) An
eclectic map, showing the province at this period,
was made up from Montanus, Roggeveen, and
others, by J. P. Bourjé, and appeared in Lambrechtsen’s
<i>Korte Beschryving</i>, Middelburg, 1818.
The maps of Nicolas Visscher in Sanson’s <i>Atlas
Nouveau</i> (1700), and of Henry Hondius and
Homan, belong to a later period.</p>

<p>Of the charts of the coast about New York,
there were two standard atlases of this period,

York in 1668, and in his <i>Zee-en Landreizen</i>,
Amsterdam, 1681, and again 1702, he gives a
detailed description of the place, borrowing
somewhat from Montanus. (Asher’s <i>Essay</i>, no.
17; and <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii. 1,221, which
says the later editions were issued in 1704-1705.)
Though an Englishman, his account was not published
in the original, and we owe the earliest
one in English to Daniel Denton, whose <i>Brief
Descriptions of New York</i> appeared in London
in 1670. It is now very rare. (Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>,
v. 350.) It is a small quarto, and Rich
priced it in 1832 at £1 12<i>s.</i> There are copies in
Harvard College Library; in the State Library,
Albany; besides two copies in the Carter-Brown
Library, with different imprints. (<i>Catalogue</i>, ii.
1,038.) Sabin, in the <i>Menzies Catalogue</i>, says
he had sold a copy for $275, and at that sale it
brought $220. (Cf. <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 2,778.)
It was reprinted by the Pennsylvania Historical
Society in 1845, 16 pp., and by Wm. Gowan in
New York the same year, with an Introduction
by Gabriel Furman, 57 pp.</p>

<p>A few years later we have another description
in the <i>Journal of a Voyage to New York</i>,
1679-80, by Jasper Dankers and Peter Sluyter,
which was translated from the original Dutch
manuscript by Henry C. Murphy, and, enriched
by an Introduction from the same hand, appeared
in 1867 as vol. i. of the <i>Memoirs</i> of the Long
Island Historical Society, and also separately.
Some particulars of Danckaerts or Dankers are
noted in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1874, p. 309.
The MS., when found by Mr. Frederick Muller,
of Amsterdam, from whom Mr. Murphy procured
it, was accompanied by certain drawings
of the town, seemingly taken on the spot. These
are given in Mr. Murphy’s volume in fac-simile,
with descriptions by Mr. J. Carson Brevoort,
who has also re-drawn certain parts of them
with better perspective, and other rectifications.
The re-drawings are also engraved. The originals
consist: (1) of a view of the Narrows,
looking out to sea; (2) of a long panoramic
view of the town as seen from the Brooklyn
shore; (3) the East River shore looking south;
(4) a view down the island from the northern
edge of the settlement, with the Hudson River
on the right, and a supposable East River on
the left. The views which Mr. Brevoort has
rectified are no. 4; the Stadthuys, with adjacent
buildings and half-moon battery, extracted from
no. 2; and three parts of no. 3, namely the Dock,
the Water-gate (foot of Wall Street), and the shore
north of the Water-gate. A reduction of the
Brevoort Stadthuys view and the original, full
size, are given herewith. This building stood
on the corner of Pearl Street and Coentys slip,
was erected as a city tavern in 1642, became a
city hall in 1655, and was torn down in 1700.
The battery when built projected into the river.
There are other views of the Stadthuys given
in Valentine’s <i>Manual</i>, (1655-56) p. 336, (1852)
p. 378, (1853) p. 472; his <i>History</i>, p. 52; Lamb’s
<i>New York</i>, i. 106; Gay’s <i>Popular History of the
United States</i>, ii. 139, etc. Mr. J. W. Gerard
published a monograph in 1875, <i>Old Stadthuys
of New Amsterdam</i>.</p>

<p>In the train of Andros, and as his chaplain, a
Rev. Charles Wooley came to New York in 1678,
and his <i>Journal of Two Years</i> was published in
1701. (<i>Historical Magazine</i>, i. 371.) There is a
copy in Harvard College Library. It was edited
in 1860, with notes by Dr. O’Callaghan, as
Gowan’s <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, no. 2; and no.
3 of the same series, J. Miller’s <i>Description of
the Province and City of New York</i> (1695), though
of a little later date, is best examined in the
same connection. It is edited by John G. Shea,
as Gowan printed it in 1862. Cf. also C. Lodwick’s

<p class="drop-cap16">ALTHOUGH that portion of the American Continent known as New
Netherland was within the limits claimed by England by virtue of
Cabot’s discovery, yet those in possession, from the comparatively little
interest taken in their proceedings, remained undisturbed until 1664.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
There had been some attempts on the part of settlers in Connecticut and
on Long Island to encroach upon lands in the occupancy of the Dutch, or
to purchase tracts from the Indians otherwise than through their intervention,
yet nothing had resulted therefrom but estrangement and animosity.
An application for the aid of the Royal government was the consequence,
and Charles II. was induced to countenance the complaints of his North
American subjects, and to enforce his right to the lands in question.</p>

<p>To effect the ends in view, a charter was granted to James, Duke of York,&mdash;Charles’s
brother,&mdash;for all the lands lying between the western side of
Connecticut River and the east side of Delaware
Bay, including Long Island, Nantucket, Martha’s
Vineyard, and the islands in their vicinity. This
charter was dated March 12, 1663/4, and the following
month a fleet of four vessels, having on board a full complement of
sailors and soldiers, was despatched to eject the Dutch and put the representatives
of the Duke of York in
possession.</p>

<p>The fleet arrived in
August, and articles of capitulation
were signed on the 19th (20th) of the same month. Colonel Richard
Nicolls, who commanded the expedition, received the surrender of the
Province the following day; and in October Sir Robert Carr secured the
capitulation of the settlements on the Delaware. By the treaty of Breda,
in 1667, the possession of the country was confirmed to the English.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>Although, as the pioneers of civilization, the Hollanders had developed,
to a considerable extent, the resources of what is now New Jersey, yet the
cultivation of the soil and the increase of population, during the half century
that had elapsed since their first occupancy, were by no means commensurate
with what might have been expected. Settlements had been
made on tracts known as Weehawken, Hoboken, Ahasimus, Pavonia, Constable’s
Hook, and Bergen, on the western banks of the Hudson River,
opposite New Amsterdam, but of their population and other evidences of
growth nothing definite is known. On the Delaware, Cornelius Jacobsen
Mey, in 1623, under the auspices of the West India Company of Holland,
and David Pieterson de Vries, in
1631, attempted to colonize South
Jersey at Fort Nassau; but to the
Swedes must be accorded the credit
of making the first successful settlements,
though few in number and insignificant in extent.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> These, in August,
1655, were surrendered to the Dutch under Peter Stuyvesant, and they
had experienced very little growth or modification when surrendered to Sir
Robert Carr in 1664.</p>

<p>Before the Duke of York was actually in possession of the territory, he
had executed deeds of lease and release to Lord John Berkeley, Baron of
Stratton, and Sir George Carteret, of Saltrum. The documents bore the
dates of June 23 and 24, 1664, and granted all that portion of his American
acquisition&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">“lying and being to the westward of Long Island and Manhitoes Island, and bounded
on the east part by the main sea and part by Hudson’s river, and hath upon the west
Delaware bay or river, and extending southward to the main ocean as far as Cape
May at the mouth of Delaware bay, and to the northward as far as the northernmost
branch of the said bay or river of Delaware, which is forty-one degrees and forty
minutes of latitude, and crosseth over thence in a straight line to Hudson’s river in
forty-one degrees of latitude; which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the
name or names of <i>New Cæsaria or New Jersey</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The two courtiers, placed in these important and interesting relations to
the people of New Jersey, were doubtless led to enter into them from being
already interested in the Province of Carolina,
and from their associations with the Duke of York.</p>

<p>Sir John Berkeley had been the governor
of the Duke in his youth, and in subsequent
years had retained great influence over him. He, as well as Sir George
Carteret, had been a firm adherent of Charles II.; and Carteret, at the
Restoration, was placed in several important positions and was an intimate
companion of James. Both Carteret and Berkeley were connected with the
Duke in the Admiralty Board, of which he was at that time the head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
consequently enjoyed peculiar facilities for influencing him. The name of
“Cæsaria” was conferred upon the tract in commemoration of the gallant
defence of the Island of Jersey, in 1649, against the Parliamentarians, by
Sir George Carteret, then governor of the island; but it was soon lost, the
English appellation of “New Jersey” being preferred.</p>

<p>The grant to the Duke of York, from the Crown, conferred upon him,
his heirs and assigns, among other rights and privileges, that of government,
subject to the approval by the King of all matters submitted for his decision;
differing therein from the Royal privileges conceded to the proprietors
of Maryland and Carolina, which were unlimited. The Duke of York,
consequently, ruled his territory in the name of the King, and when it was
transferred to Berkeley and Carteret,
they, “their heirs and assigns,” were
invested with all the powers conferred
upon the Duke “in as full and ample
manner” as he himself possessed them,
including, as was conceived, the right of government, although it was not
so stated expressly,&mdash;thus transferring with the land the allegiance and
obedience of the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-423.jpg" width="250" height="82" id="i423"

</div>

<p>On Feb. 10, 1664/5, without having had any communication with the
inhabitants, or acquiring a knowledge by personal inspection of the peculiarities
of the country, Berkeley and Carteret signed an instrument which
they published under the title of “The Concessions and Agreements of the
Lords Proprietors of New Jersey, to and with all and every of the adventurers
and all such as shall settle and plant there.” This, the first Constitution
of New Jersey, was regarded by the people as the great charter of
their liberties, and respected accordingly. By its provisions the government
of the Province was confided to a governor, a council of not less than six
nor more than twelve to be selected by the governor, and an assembly of
twelve representatives to be chosen annually by the freemen of the Province.
The governor and council were clothed with power to appoint and
remove all officers,&mdash;freeholders alone to be appointed to office unless by
consent of the assembly,&mdash;to exercise a general supervision over all courts,
and to be executors of the laws. They were to direct the manner of laying
out of lands, and were not to impose, nor permit to be imposed, any tax
upon the people not authorized by the general assembly. That body was
authorized to pass all laws for the government of the Province, subject to
the approval of the governor, to remain in force one year, during which
time they were to be submitted to the Lords Proprietors. To encourage
planters, every freeman who should embark with the first governor, or meet
him on his arrival, provided with a “good musket, bore twelve bullets to
the pound, with bandoliers and match convenient, and with six months’ provisions
for himself,” was promised one hundred and fifty acres of land, and
the like number for every man-servant or slave brought with him similarly
provided. To females over the age of fourteen, seventy-five acres were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
promised, and a similar number to every Christian servant at the expiration
of his or her term of service. Those going subsequently, but before Jan.
1, 1666, were to receive one hundred and twenty acres, if master, mistress,
or able man-servant or slave; and weaker servants, male or female, sixty
acres. Those going during the fourth year were to have one half of these
quantities.</p>

<p>In the laying out of towns and boroughs the proprietors reserved one
seventh of the land to themselves. To all who might become entitled to
any land, a warrant was to be obtained from the governor directing the surveyor
to lay out the several tracts, which being done, a grant or patent was
to be issued, signed by the governor and the major part of the council, subject
to a yearly quit-rent of not less than one halfpenny per acre, the payment
of which was to begin in 1670. Each parish was to be allowed two
hundred acres for the use of its ministers. Liberty of conscience was guaranteed
to all becoming subjects of England, and swearing allegiance to the
King and fidelity to the Lords Proprietors; and the assembly of the Province
was authorized to appoint as many ministers as should be thought proper,
and to provide for their maintenance. Such were the principal provisions
of this fundamental Constitution of the Province.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>On the same day that the Concessions were signed, Philip Carteret, a
distant relative of Sir George, was commissioned governor, and received his
instructions. Preparations
were at once made
for his departure, accompanied
by all such
as were willing to emigrate
to New Jersey;
and in April he sailed,
with about thirty adventurers
and servants,
in the ship “Philip,” laden with suitable commodities. The vessel was first
heard of as being in Virginia in May, and she arrived at New York on July
29. Here Carteret was informed that Governor Nicolls, in entire ignorance
of the transfer of New Jersey to Lords Berkeley and Carteret, had authorized
and confirmed a purchase made of the Indians, by a party from Long
Island, of a tract of land lying on the west side of the strait between Staten
Island and the main land, and that four families had emigrated thither.
Nicolls had also confirmed to other parties a tract lying near to Sandy
Hook, which they had purchased from the Indians. This led to the settlement
of Middletown and Shrewsbury, in what is now Monmouth County,&mdash;the
two grants laying the foundation for much subsequent trouble in the
administration of the public affairs of the Province.</p>

<p>In consequence of these developments the prow of the “Philip” was
directed by Carteret towards the new settlement at what is now Elizabeth;
and arriving there early in August, he landed, as it is said, with a hoe upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
his shoulder, thereby indicating his intention to become a planter with those
already there, and conferring upon the embryo town the name it now bears,
after the lady of Sir George Carteret.</p>

<p>Among Carteret’s first measures for the improvement of the Province
was the sending of messengers to New England and elsewhere, to publish
the Concessions and to invite settlers,&mdash;measures which resulted in a considerable
accession to the population. The ship “Philip” returned to England
in about six months, and brought out the next year “more people and
goods” on account of the Proprietors; and other vessels, similarly laden,
followed from time to time.</p>

<p>In 1666 a division of the Elizabethtown tract was effected, leading to the
settlement of Woodbridge and Piscataway. Another settlement,&mdash;formed
by immigrants from Milford, Guilford, Branford, and New Haven, and having
a desire, they said in their agreement, “to be of one heart and consent,
through God’s blessing, that with one hand they may endeavor the carrying
on of spiritual concernments, as also civil and town affairs according to God
and a godly government,”&mdash;became the nucleus of Newark (now the most
populous city in New Jersey), only such planters as belonged to some one
of the Congregational churches being allowed to vote or hold office in the
town. These, with the settlements mentioned as having been begun under
the Dutch administration, comprised all which for some years attracted
immigration from other quarters. Thus gradually New Jersey obtained an
enterprising, industrious population sufficiently large to develop in no small
degree its varied capabilities.</p>

<p>The Indians were considered generally as beneficial to the new settlements.
The obtaining of furs, skins, and game, which added both to the
traffic of the Province and to the support of the inhabitants, was thus secured
with less difficulty than if they had been obliged to depend upon
their own exertions for the needed supply. The different tribes were more
or less connected with or subordinate to the confederated Indians of New
York, and the settlers in New Jersey enjoyed, in consequence, peculiar protection.
As the Proprietors evinced no disposition to deprive them of their
lands, but in all cases made what was deemed an adequate remuneration
for such as were purchased, New Jersey was preserved from those unhappy
collisions which resulted in such vital injury to the settlements in other parts
of the country.</p>

<p>Governor Carteret did not think that any legislation was immediately
necessary for the government of the people or administration of the affairs
of the Province. The Concessions having been tried were found quite adequate
to the requirements of the new settlements, but on April 7, 1668, he
issued his proclamation ordering the election of two freeholders from each
town to meet in a general assembly the ensuing month at Elizabethtown;
and on May 26 the first Assembly in New Jersey began a session which
closed on the 30th. During the session a bill of pains and penalties was
passed, identical in some respects with the Levitical law. Other subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
were considered; but “by reason of the week so near spent and the resolution
of some of the company to depart,” definite action was postponed
until the ensuing session, which was held on November 3, in which deputies
from the southern portion of the Province on the Delaware took part. A
few acts were passed relating to weights and measures, fines, and dealings
with the Indians; but on the fourth day of the session the Assembly adjourned
<i>sine die</i>, the deputies excusing themselves therefor in a message to
the Governor and Council, in which they say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We, finding so many and great inconveniences by our not sitting together, and
your apprehension so different to ours, and your expectations that things must go according
to your opinions, they can see no reason for, much less warrant from the Concessions;
wherefore we think it vain to spend much time in returning answers by meetings
that are so exceeding dilatory, if not fruitless and endless, and therefore we think
our way rather to break up our meeting, seeing the order of the Concessions cannot be
attended to.”</p>

<p class="p1">A proposition by the Governor and Council, that a committee should be
appointed to consult with them upon the asserted deviations from the Concessions,
was not heeded, and the Assembly adjourned. Seven years elapsed
before another, of which there is any authentic record, met. There are intimations
of meetings of deputies on two occasions in 1671; but what was
done thereat is not known, excepting the establishing of a Court of Oyer
and Terminer.</p>

<p>This neglect to provide for the regular meeting of the General Assembly
of the Province was doubtless owing to the disaffection then existing among
the inhabitants of what was subsequently known as the Monmouth Patent,
including Middletown, Shrewsbury, and other settlements holding their
lands under the grant from Nicolls, which has been mentioned. As they
considered themselves authorized to pass such prudential laws as they
deemed advisable, they were led to hold a local assembly for the purpose
as early as June, 1667, at what is now called the Highlands; and not being
disposed to acknowledge fully the claims of the Lords Proprietors, they refused
to publish the laws passed at the first session of the General Assembly
and would not permit them to be enforced within their limits, on the ground
that the deputies, professedly representing them, had not been lawfully
elected. Certain differences in the Nicolls grant, from the Concessions, were
insisted on before the deputies representing those towns could be allowed
to co-operate in any legislation affecting them.</p>

<p>These views were not acceded to, and the towns were consequently not
represented in the Assembly of November, 1668, and the first open hostility
to the government of Carteret was inaugurated. This, however, did not
interfere materially with his administration of the affairs of the Province.
In every other quarter harmony prevailed until the time came when, by
the provisions of the Concessions, the first quit-rents became payable by
those holding lands under the Proprietors. The arrival of March 25, 1670,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
when their collection was to begin, introduced decided and, in many
quarters, violent opposition. Information received from England of a
probable change in the proprietorship, which promised a reannexation
of New Jersey to New York, no doubt added to the apprehensions of
the Governor and his Council, and gave encouragement to the disaffected
among the people.</p>

<p>The Elizabethtown settlers, asserting their right to the lands confirmed
to them by Governor Nicolls independent of the requisitions of the Concessions,
became the central instruments of action for the disaffected. The
claims of the Proprietors’ officers, the oaths of allegiance which many of
them had taken, as well as their duty to those whose liberal concessions constituted
the chief inducements for settlement within their jurisdiction, were
alike unheeded. The titles acquired through Nicolls they attempted to uphold
as of superior force, and, following the example of Middletown and
Shrewsbury, although on less tenable grounds, they were disposed to question
the authority of the government in other matters. For two years there
was a prevalent state of confusion, anxiety, and doubt.</p>

<p>On March 26, 1672, there was a meeting of deputies from the different
towns; but the validity of such an Assembly, as it was called, the governor
and council did not recognize. The proceedings are presumed to have had
reference to the vexed question of titles; but the documents connected with
the meeting were all suppressed by the secretary, who was also assistant-secretary
of the council, and he acted, it is presumed, under their instructions.
Another meeting was held at Elizabethtown on May 14, composed of representatives
of Elizabethtown, Newark, Woodbridge, Piscataway, and Bergen;
but assembling “without the knowledge, approbation, or consent” of the
governor and council, they of course did not co-operate. The Concessions
stipulated that the general assembly should consist of the “representatives,
or the majority of them, with the governor and council,” and their absence
afforded an excuse for another step toward independence of the established
authorities. The Concessions provided that, should the governor refuse to
be present in person or by deputy, the general assembly might “appoint
themselves a president during the absence of the governor or the deputy-governor;”
and the assembly proceeded to do so (not, however, a president
merely to preside over their deliberations and give effect to their acts, but
a “president of the country,” to exercise the chief authority in the Province),
finding a ready co-operator in James Carteret, a son of Sir George,
then in New Jersey on his way to Carolina, of which he had been made a
landgrave.</p>

<p>He appears to have been courteously received by the authorities of the
Province, from his near relationship to the proprietor, but his course argues
little consideration for them or for the interests of his father. He did not
hesitate to assume the chief authority; and, although the governor issued a
proclamation denouncing both him and the body which had conferred authority
upon him, yet power to enforce obedience seems to have been with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the usurper. Officers of the government were seized and imprisoned, and
in some instances their property was confiscated.</p>

<p>Governor Carteret had deemed it advisable to seek his safety by taking
up his residence in Bergen, where on May 28 he convened his council for
deliberation. They advised him to go to England, to explain to the Lords
Proprietors the situation of the
Province, and to have his authority
confirmed. This he
did, taking with him James
Bollen, the secretary of the
council, and appointing John
Berry deputy-governor in his
absence. Their reception by the Proprietors was all that they could have
expected or desired. Sir George Carteret sent directions to his son to vacate
his usurped authority at once and proceed to Carolina; and the Duke
of York wrote to Governor Lovelace, who had succeeded Nicolls in the
Province of New York, notifying him, and requiring him to make the same
known to the insurgents, that the claims they had advanced would not be
recognized by him; and King Charles II. himself sent a missive to Deputy-Governor
Berry confirming his authority and commanding obedience to the
government of the Lords Proprietors. Other documents from the Proprietors
expressed in temperate but decided language their determination to
support the rights which had been conferred upon them, and some modifications
of the Concessions were made, which circumstances seemed to require,
conferring additional powers on the governor and council.</p>

<p>These various documents were published by Deputy-Governor Berry in
May, 1673. They served to quiet the previous agitation, and to re-establish
his authority. A certain time was allowed the malecontents to comply with
the terms of the Proprietors; and the inhabitants of Middletown and Shrewsbury
placed themselves in a more favorable position than those of other
towns by asking for a suspension of proceedings against them until they
could communicate with the authorities in England. This they did, throwing
themselves upon their generous forbearance by relinquishing any special
privileges they had claimed under the Nicolls patent, receiving individual
grants of land in lieu thereof; and thereafter the relations between them and
the proprietary government were always harmonious.</p>

<p>The government was resumed by the representatives of the Proprietors
without any exhibition of exultation; and further to insure tranquillity and
good conduct the deputy-governor and council issued an order with the
intent “to prevent deriding, or uttering words of reproach, to any that had
been guilty” of the insubordination.</p>

<p>In March, 1673, Charles II., in co-operation with Louis XIV. of France,
declared war against Holland; and before the time expired, within which the
proffered terms were to be acceded to by the inhabitants, the Dutch were
again in possession of the country. The manner in which New Netherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
had been subdued by the English prompted a like retaliation, and a
squadron of five vessels was at once despatched against New York. The
fleet was increased, by captures on the way, to sixteen vessels, conveying
sixteen hundred men; and on August 8 possession of the fort was obtained,
and for more than a year the authority of the States General was acknowledged.
On the one hand, no harshness or disposition to violate the just
rights of the inhabitants was manifested; while, on the other, imaginary injuries
from the proprietary government led to a ready recognition of what
might prove an advantageous change. The natural consequences were harmony
and good-will.</p>

<p>The inhabitants generally were confirmed in the possession of their lawfully
acquired lands, and placed on an equality, as to privileges, with the
Hollanders themselves. Local governments were established for each town,
consisting of six schepens, or magistrates, and two deputies toward the constitution
of a joint board, for the purpose of nominating three persons for
schouts and three for secretaries. From the nominations thus made the
council would select three magistrates for each town, and for the six towns
collectively a schout and secretary. John Ogden and Samuel Hopkins were
severally appointed to these offices on the 1st of September.</p>

<p>On November 18 a code of laws was promulgated “by the schout and
magistrates of Achter Kol Assembly, held at Elizabethtown to make laws
and orders,” but it does not appear to have been framed with any reference
to the English laws in force, which it was intended to subvert. It was singularly
mild in the character and extent of the punishments to be inflicted on
transgressors, the principal aim of the legislators apparently being the protection
of the Province from the demoralizing effects of sensual indulgence
and other vicious propensities; but the whole code soon became a nullity,
through the abrogation of the authority under which it was enacted.</p>

<p>On Feb. 9, 1674, a treaty of peace was signed at Westminster, the eighth
article of which restored the country to the English; and they continued in
undisturbed possession from the November following until the war which
secured the independence of the United States of America.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of peace the Duke of York obtained from the King a
new patent, dated June 29, 1674, similar in its privileges and extent to the
first; and on October 30 Edmund Andros arrived with a commission as governor,
clothing him with power to take possession of New York and its dependencies,
which, in the words of the commission included “all the land from
the west side of Connecticut River to the east side of Delaware Bay.” On
November 9 he issued a proclamation in which he expressly declared that
all former grants, privileges, or concessions, and all estates legally possessed
by and under His Royal Highness before the late Dutch government, were
thereby confirmed, and the possessors by virtue thereof to remain in quiet
possession of their rights. King Charles on June 13, prior to the issuing of
a new patent by the Duke of York, wrote a circular letter confirming in all
respects the title and power of Carteret in East Jersey.</p>

</div>

<p>On July 28 and 29, 1674, Sir George Carteret received a new grant from
the Duke of York, equally full as to rights and privileges, giving him individually
all of the Province north of a line drawn from a certain “creek
called Barnegat to a certain creek on Delaware River, next adjoining to and
below a certain creek on Delaware River called Rankokus Kill,” a stream
south of what is now Burlington,&mdash;the sale of Berkeley’s interest in the
Province being evidently considered as leading to its division.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>This had taken place on March 18, 1673/4, Lord Berkeley disposing of his
portion of the Province to John Fenwicke,&mdash;Edward Byllynge being interested
in the transaction. As these
two were members of the Society
of Quakers, or Friends, who had
experienced much persecution in
England, it is thought that in making
this purchase they had in view
the securing for themselves and their religious associates a place of retreat.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""

</div>

<p>Some difficulty was experienced in determining the respective interests of
Fenwicke and Byllynge in
the property they had acquired,
and the intervention
of William Penn was secured.
He awarded one tenth of the Province, with a considerable sum of
money, to Fenwicke, and the remaining nine tenths to Byllynge. Not long
after, Byllynge, who was a merchant, met
with misfortunes, which obliged him to make
a conveyance of his interest to others. It was
therefore assigned to three of his fellow associates
among the Quakers,&mdash;William Penn, Gawen Lawrie, and Nicholas
Lucas. This conveyance was signed Feb.
10, 1674. The nine undivided tenths were
assigned to the three persons just mentioned,
to be held by them in trust for the benefit of Byllynge’s creditors; and not
long after Fenwicke’s tenth was also placed under their control, although he
had executed a lease to John Eldridge and Edmond Warner for a thousand
years, to secure the repayment of sums of money obtained from them. A
discretionary power to sell was conferred by the lease, leading to complications
of title and management.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>Philip Carteret had remained in England until the negotiations subsequent
to the surrender of the Dutch were completed and the new grant for
East Jersey obtained; and on July 31, 1674, he was recommissioned as governor,
and returned to the Province, bringing with him further regulations
respecting the laying out of lands, the payment of quit-rents, and other
obligations of the settlers. His return seems to have greatly pleased the
people of East Jersey. His commission, and the other documents of which
he was made the bearer, were published at Bergen, Nov. 6, 1674, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
presence of his council and commissioners from all the towns except
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>After the Governor’s return the assemblies met annually with considerable
regularity, the first at Elizabethtown on Nov. 5, 1675, and the others
either there or at Woodbridge or Middletown. Sufficient unanimity seems
to have prevailed among the different branches of government, to secure
legislation upon all subjects which the advancement of the Province in
population rendered essential.</p>

<p>As yet no material change in the condition of West Jersey as to settlement
had taken place; but in 1675 John Fenwicke, with many others, came
over in the ship “Griffith” from London and landed at what is now Salem,&mdash;so
called by them from the peaceful aspect which the site then wore. No
other settlers, however, arrived for two years.</p>

<p>Although the commission of Andros as governor of New York authorized
him to take possession of the Province “and its dependencies,” yet
having been conversant with the transactions in England affecting New
Jersey, which had taken place subsequent to its date, he did not presume
at first to assert his authority over that Province, otherwise than to collect
duties there similar to those constituting the Duke’s revenue in New York.
Soon after his arrival he took measures to collect the same customs at
Hoarkill, in West Jersey; and on the arrival of Fenwicke with his settlers
at Salem, a meeting of his council was held Dec. 5, 1675, at which an order
was issued prohibiting any privilege or freedom of customs or trading on
the eastern shore of the Delaware, nor was Fenwicke to be recognized as
owner or proprietor of any land. As this prohibition was not regarded by
Fenwicke, on Nov. 8, 1676, directions were given to the council at Newcastle
to arrest him and send him to New York. This proceeding not being
acquiesced in by Fenwicke, a judicial and military force was despatched in
December to make the arrest. On producing, for the inspection of Andros,
the King’s Letters Patent, the Duke of York’s grant to Berkeley and Carteret,
and Lord Berkeley’s deed to himself, Fenwicke was allowed to return
to West Jersey, on condition that he should present himself again on or
before the 6th of October following,&mdash;the fact that the Duke was authorized
to, and did, transfer all his rights in New Jersey, “in as full and ample
manner” as he had received them, being an argument that Andros could
not readily refute. Fenwicke complied with the prescribed terms of his
release and, after some detention as a prisoner, was liberated (as asserted by
Andros) on his parole not to assume any authority in West Jersey until
further warrant should be given.</p>

<p>It being evident that the grant of the Duke of York to Sir George Carteret
in July, 1674, had not made an equitable division of the Province
between him and the assigns of Sir John Berkeley, the Duke induced Sir
George to relinquish that grant, and another deed of division was executed
on July 1, 1676, known as the Quintipartite Deed, making the dividing line
to run from Little Egg Harbor to what was called the northernmost branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
of the Delaware River, in 41° 40´ north latitude; and from that time the
measures adopted by the Proprietors of the two provinces to advance the
interests of their respective portions were enforced separately and independently
of each other.</p>

<p>The trustees of Byllynge effected sales of land to two companies of
Friends, one from Yorkshire and the other from London; and in 1677
commissioners were sent out with power to purchase lands of the natives,
to lay out the various patents that might be issued, and otherwise administer
the government. The ship “Kent” was sent over with two hundred and
thirty passengers, and after a long passage she arrived in the Delaware in
August (1677), and the following month a settlement was made on the site
of the present Burlington.</p>

<p>The commissioners came in the “Kent,” which, on her way to the Delaware,
anchored at Sandy Hook. Thence the commissioners proceeded to
New York to inform Governor Andros of their intentions; and, although
they failed to secure an absolute surrender of his authority over their lands,
he promised them his aid in getting their rights acknowledged, they in the
mean time acting as magistrates under him, and being permitted to carry
out the views of the Proprietors. During the following months of 1677,
and in 1678, several hundred more immigrants arrived and located themselves
on the Yorkshire and London tracts, or tenths as they were called.</p>

<p>The settlers of West Jersey, as a body, were too intelligent for them to
remain long without an established form of government, and on March 3,
1677, a code of laws was adopted under the title of “The Concessions and
Agreements of the Proprietors, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the Province
of West Jersey.” It was drawn up, as is presumed, by William Penn and
his immediate coadjutors, as his name heads the list of signers, of whom
there were one hundred and fifty-one. The chief or executive authority
was by these Concessions lodged in the hands of commissioners to be appointed
by the then Proprietors, and their provisions cannot but meet with
general approval. This code is to be considered as the first example of
Quaker legislation, and is marked by great liberality. The framers, as a
proprietary body, retained no authority exclusively to themselves, but placed
all power in the hands of the people. The document was to be read at the
beginning and close of each general assembly; and, that all might know its
provisions, four times in a year it was to be read in a solemn manner in
every hall of justice in the Province.</p>

<p>The settlers on Fenwicke’s tenth did not participate in the privileges of
these Concessions. On returning to the Province, after his confinement in
New York, Fenwicke proceeded to make choice of officers for his colony,
demanding in the name of the King the submission of the people, and directly
afterward issued a proclamation in which he&mdash;as “Lord and Chief
Proprietor of the said Province [West Jersey], and in particular Fenwicke’s
colony within the same”&mdash;required all persons to appear before him within
one month and show their orders or warrants for “their pretended titles,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
assuming an independent authority entirely at variance with the proprietary
directions.</p>

<p>The commissioners of the Byllynge tenths, however, do not appear to
have made any attempt to interfere with him, confining their authority to
the limits of their own well defined tracts; but if Fenwicke escaped annoyance
from his near neighbors he was not so fortunate in his relations
with his former persecutor, Andros, as he is represented as being, not long
after his return, again at Newcastle under arrest, waiting for some opportunity
to be sent again to New York.</p>

<p>Although, as has been stated, general quietude prevailed in East Jersey
for some years after Carteret’s return from England, yet it must be considered
as resulting less from the desire of the people to co-operate with him,
than from the want of leaders willing to guide and uphold them in ultra
proceedings. The exaction of customs in New York, by direction of the
representatives of the Duke of York, operated more to the annoyance of
the inhabitants on the Delaware than to those in the eastern portion of the
Province, and it was with great anxiety that the adventurers to West Jersey
regarded the course of Andros in relation thereto; but in East Jersey, the
proximity to New York rendered a direct trade with foreign lands less necessary.
Andros steadily opposed all projects of the Governor to render
East Jersey more independent of New York, and the death of Sir George
Carteret in January, 1680, seems to have inspired him with fresh vigor in
asserting the claims of the Duke of York. Recalling to mind that New
Jersey was within the limits of his jurisdiction according to his commission,
he addressed a letter to Governor Carteret in March, 1679/80, informing
him that, being advised of his acting without legal authority to the great
disturbance of His Majesty’s subjects, he required him to cease exercising
any authority whatever within the limits of the Duke of York’s patent,
unless his lawful power so to do was first recorded in New York. To this
unlooked for and unwarranted communication, Governor Carteret replied
on March 20, two days after its receipt, informing his indignant correspondent
that after consultation with his council he and they were prepared to
defend themselves and families against any and all aggressions, having a
perfect conviction of the validity of the authority they exercised. Before
this letter was received by Andros, or even written, he had issued a proclamation
abrogating the government of Carteret and requiring all persons to
submit to the King’s authority as embodied in himself. Emissaries were
despatched to East Jersey to undermine the authority of Carteret, and every
other means adopted to estrange the people from their adhesion to the Proprietary
government.</p>

<p>On April 7 Andros, accompanied by his council, presented himself at
Elizabethtown, and Carteret, finding that they were unattended by any military
force, dismissed a body of one hundred and fifty men gathered for his
defence; and, receiving his visitors with civility, a mutual exposition was
made of their respective claims to the government of East Jersey. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
conference ended as it had begun. Andros having now, as he said, performed
his duty by fully presenting his authority and demanding the government
in behalf of His Majesty, cautioned them against refusal. “Then
we went to dinner,” says Carteret in his account of the interview, “and that
done we accompanied him to the ship, and so parted.”</p>

<p>Carteret’s hospitality, however, was lost upon Andros. On April 30 a
party of soldiers, sent by him, dragged the Governor from his bed and carried
him to New York, bruised and maltreated, where he was kept in prison
until May 27, when a special court was convened for his trial for having
“persisted and riotously and routously endeavored to maintain the exercise
of jurisdiction and government over His Majesty’s subjects within the
bounds of His Majesty’s letters-patent to His Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>Carteret boldly maintained his independence under these trying circumstances.
He fully acknowledged before the court his refusal to surrender
his government to Andros without the special command of the King, submitted
the various documents bearing upon the subject, and protested
against the jurisdiction of a court where his accuser and imprisoner was
also his judge.</p>

<p>The jury brought in a verdict of “not guilty,” which Andros would not
receive, obliging them to reconsider their action, two or three times; and it
is somewhat singular that they should have held firm to their first decision.
They, however, gave in so far as to require Governor Carteret to give security
not to exercise any authority on his return to East Jersey, until the
matter could be referred to the authorities in England.</p>

<p>Andros lost no time in profiting by Carteret’s violent deposition, for
although it is said that, attended by his whole retinue of ladies and gentlemen,
he escorted Carteret to his home in Elizabethtown, yet on June 2
Andros met the Assembly at that place, presented again his credentials,
and recommended such enactments as would confirm all past judicial proceedings,
and the adoption of the laws in force in New York. The representatives,
while they treated Andros with respect, were not unmindful of
what was due to themselves as freemen. They were not prepared to bow in
submission even to His Majesty’s Letters Patent, whenever at variance with
their true rights. “What we have formerly done,” said they, “we did in
obedience to the authority that was then established in this Province: these
things, which have been done according to law, require no confirmation.”
They presented for the approval of Andros the laws already in force as
adapted to their circumstances, and expressed their expectations that the
privileges conferred by the Concessions would be confirmed. It does not
appear that their views were dissented from by Andros, or that his visit was
productive of either good or evil results.</p>

<p>In consequence of the dilatoriness of the Proprietary in England, Carteret
was kept in suspense until the beginning of the next year; but on
March 2, 1681, he issued a proclamation announcing the receipt by him of
the gratifying intelligence that the Duke of York had disavowed the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
of Andros and denied having conferred upon him any authority that could
in the least have derogated from that vested in the Proprietary; and a letter
from the Duke’s secretary, to Andros himself, notified him that His Royal
Highness had relinquished all right or claim to the Province, except the
reserved rent.</p>

<p>About this time Andros returned to England, leaving Anthony Brocholst,
president of the council, as his representative. There is some mystery
about his conduct towards New Jersey. He may have thought that
the party in East Jersey, inimical to the proprietary government, might
enable him to regain possession of it for the Duke, and thereby increase
the estimation in which he might be held by him. For Andros had enemies
in New York who had interested themselves adversely to his interests,
making such an impression upon the Duke that his voyage to England at
this time was taken in accordance with the express command of his superior,
to answer certain charges preferred against him.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the common enemy soon reproduced the bickerings
and disputings which had characterized much of Carteret’s administration.
He convened an Assembly at Elizabethtown in October, 1681, at which such
violent altercations took place that the Governor, for the first time in the history
of New Jersey, dissolved the Assembly, contrary to the wishes of the
representatives. This was the last Assembly during the administration of
Carteret, for the ensuing year he resigned the government into other hands.</p>

<p>Sir George Carteret died, as has been stated, in 1680, leaving his widow,
Lady Elizabeth, his executrix. He devised his interest in New Jersey to
eight trustees in trust for the benefit of his creditors; and their attention
was immediately given to finding a purchaser, by private application or public
advertisement. These modes of proceeding proving unsuccessful it
was offered at public sale to the highest bidder, and William Penn and
eleven associates, all thought to have been Quakers, and some of whom
were already interested in West Jersey, became the purchasers for £3,400.
Their deeds of lease and release were dated Feb. 1 and 2, 1681/2, and subsequently
each one sold one half of his interest to a new associate, making
in all twenty-four proprietors. On March 14, 1681/2, the Duke of York
confirmed the sale of the Province to the Twenty-four by giving a new grant
more full and explicit than any previous one, in which their names are inserted
in the following order: James, Earl of Perth, John Drummond, Robert
Barclay, David Barclay, Robert Gordon, Arent Sonmans, <i>William Penn</i>,
<i>Robert West</i>, <i>Thomas Rudyard</i>, <i>Samuel Groom</i>, <i>Thomas Hart</i>, <i>Richard Mew</i>,
<i>Ambrose Rigg</i>, <i>John Heywood</i>, <i>Hugh Hartshorne</i>, <i>Clement Plumstead</i>,
<i>Thomas Cooper</i>, Gawen Lawrie, Edward Byllynge, James Brain, William
Gibson, Thomas Barker, Robert Turner, and Thomas Warne,&mdash;those in
italics being the names of eleven of the first twelve, <i>Thomas Wilcox</i>, the
twelfth, having parted with his entire interest.</p>

<p>There was a strange commingling of religions, professions, and characters
in these Proprietors, among them being, as the historian Wynne observes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
“High Prerogative men (especially those from Scotland), Dissenters, Papists,
and Quakers.” This bringing together such a diversity of political and
religious ideas and habits was doubtless with a view to harmonize any outside
influences that it might be deemed advisable to secure, in order to advance the
interests of the Province. A government composed entirely of Quakers or
Dissenters or Royalists might have failed to meet the co-operation desired,
whereas a combination of all might have been expected to unite all parties.</p>

</div>

<p>Robert Barclay of Urie, a Scottish gentleman, a Quaker, and a personal
friend of William Penn, was selected to be governor. He occupied a high
position among those of his religion for the influence
exerted in their behalf, and for the numerous
works written by him in defence of their principles,&mdash;the
most celebrated being <i>An Apology for the
True Christian Divinity as the same is preached
and held forth by the people, in scorn, called Quakers</i>,&mdash;and moreover he
was equally capable of excelling in worldly matters. He was subsequently
commissioned governor for life; and, as if his name alone were
sufficient to insure a successful administration of the affairs of the Province,
he was not required to visit East Jersey in person, but might exercise his
authority there by deputy. He selected for that position Thomas Rudyard,
an eminent lawyer of London, originally from the town of Rudyard
in Staffordshire. It was probably from his connection with the trials of
prominent Quakers, in 1670, that he became interested in the East Jersey
project. He took an active part in the preliminary measures for advancing
the designs of the Proprietors. The Concessions, their plans for one or
more towns, a map of the country, and other documents were deposited at
his residence in London for the inspection of all adventurers.</p>

<p>The entire population of East Jersey at this time was estimated at about
five thousand, occupying Shrewsbury, Middletown, Piscataway, Woodbridge,
Elizabethtown, Newark, Bergen, and the country in their respective
vicinities.</p>

<p>Deputy-Governor Rudyard, accompanied by Samuel Groom as receiver
and surveyor-general, arrived in the Province in November 1682, and both
were favorably impressed by the condition and advantages of the country.
On December 10 following the council was appointed, consisting of Colonel
Lewis Morris, Captain John Berry, Captain William Sandford, Lawrence Andress,
and Benjamin Price, before whom, on December 20, the deputy-governor
took his oath of office, having previously on the 1st been sworn as chief
register of the Proprietors. The instructions with which Rudyard was furnished
by the Proprietors or Governor Barclay are not on record, but they
are presumed to have been in accordance with the terms of a letter to the
planters and inhabitants, with which he was furnished, inculcating harmony
and earnest endeavors to advance their joint interests. The previous Concessions
being confirmed, Rudyard convened an Assembly at Elizabethtown,
March 1, 1683; and during the year two additional sessions were held and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
several acts of importance passed. Among them was one establishing the
bounds of four counties into which the Province was divided. “Bergen”
included the settlements between the Hudson and Hackensack rivers, and
extended to the northern bounds of the Province; “Essex” included all
the country north of the dividing line between Woodbridge and Elizabethtown,
and west of the Hackensack; “Middlesex” took in all the lands from
the Woodbridge line on the north to Chesapeake Harbor on the southeast,
and back southwest and northwest to the Province bounds; and “Monmouth”
comprised the residue.</p>

<p>Although the administration of Rudyard appears to have been productive
of beneficial results, securing a great degree of harmony among the varied
interests prevailing in the Province, yet, differing from him in opinion as to
the policy of certain measures, the Proprietors, while their confidence in
him seems to have been unimpaired, thought proper to put another in his
place. The principal reason, therefore, appears to have been that Rudyard
and the surveyor-general Groom differed as to the mode of laying out
lands. The Concessions contemplated the division of all large tracts into
seven parts, one of which was to be for the Proprietors and their heirs.
Groom refused to obey the warrants of survey for such tracts unless such
an interest of the Proprietors therein was recognized, but the governor and
his council took the position that the patents, not the surveys, determined
the rights of the parties; and, to have their views carried out, Groom was
dismissed and Philip Wells appointed to be his successor. The Proprietors
in England, regarding this measure as probably in some way lessening
their profits in the Province, sustained the surveyor-general’s views and
annulled all grants not made in accordance therewith, and appointed as
Rudyard’s successor Gawen Lawrie, a merchant of London,&mdash;the same influential
Quaker whom we have seen deeply interested already in West Jersey
as one of Byllynge’s trustees, and whose intelligence and active business
qualifications made his administration of affairs conspicuous.</p>

<p>His commission was dated at London in July 1683, but he did not take
his oath of office until February 28 following. Rudyard retained the offices
of secretary and register and performed their duties until the close of 1685,
when he left for Barbadoes, being succeeded as secretary by James Emott.
Lawrie retained Messrs. Morris, Berry, Sandford, and Price of Rudyard’s
council, and appointed four others, Richard Hartshorne of Monmouth,
Isaac Kingsland of New Barbadoes, Thomas Codrington of Middlesex,
Henry Lyon of Elizabeth, and Samuel Dennis of Woodbridge.</p>

<p>The new deputy-governor brought out with him a code of general laws&mdash;or
fundamental constitutions as they were called, consisting of twenty-four
chapters, or articles, adopted by the Proprietors in England&mdash;which was considered
by its framers, for reasons not apparent, as so superior to the Concessions,
that only those who would submit to a resurvey and approval of
their several grants, arrange for the payment of quit-rents, and agree to pass
an act for the permanent support of the government should enjoy its protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
and privileges. All others were to be ruled in accordance with the
Concessions. This virtually established two codes of laws for the Province.
Lawrie, however, seems to have been convinced of the impropriety of putting
the new code in force, although in his instructions he was directed as
soon as possible to “order it to be passed in an assembly and settle the
country according thereto.” Through his discretion, therefore, the civil
policy of the Province remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The country made a most favorable impression upon Lawrie. “There is
not a poor body in all the Province, nor that wants,” wrote he to the Proprietors
in England; and he urged them to hasten emigration as rapidly as
possible,&mdash;discovering in the sparseness of the population one great cause
of the difficulties his predecessors had encountered, an increase in the number
of inhabitants favorable to the Proprietors’ interests being essential.</p>

<p>The Proprietors, however, had not been so unmindful of their interests
as not to exert themselves to induce emigration to their newly acquired
territory. The first twelve associates directly after receiving the deed for the
Province published a <i>Brief Account of the Province of East Jersey</i>, presenting
it in a very favorable light, and in 1683 the Scotch Proprietors issued
a publication of a similar character. These publications, aided by the
personal influence of Governor Barclay over their countrymen, who at that
time were greatly dissatisfied with their political condition, and suffering
under religious persecution, excited considerable interest for the Province,
and a number of emigrants were soon on their way across the Atlantic.
Many of them were sent out in the employ of different Proprietors, or
under such agreements as would afford their principals the benefits of
headland grants, fifty acres being allowed to each master of a family and
twenty-five for each person composing it, whether wife, child, or servant,&mdash;each
servant to be bound three years, at the expiration of which time he or
she was to be allowed to take up thirty acres on separate account.</p>

<p>Only a limited success, however, attended these exertions; national and
religious ties were not so easily severed. Notwithstanding the ills that
pressed so heavily upon them and their countrymen, the voluntary and
perpetual exile which they were asked to take upon them required more
earnest and pertinent appeals; and therefore, in 1685, a work appeared entitled
<i>The Model of the Government of the Province of East New Jersey in
America</i>, written by George Scot of Pitlochie at the request of the Proprietors,
in which the objections to emigration were refuted, and the condition
of the new country stated at length. Further reference to this publication
will be made hereafter; it is sufficient to state at present that it led to
the embarkation of nearly two hundred persons for East Jersey on board
a vessel named the “Henry and Francis,”&mdash;a name which deserves as permanent
a position in the annals of New Jersey as does that of the “Mayflower”
in those of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The instructions of the Proprietors to Deputy-Governor Lawrie&mdash;while
firm in their requirements for the execution of all engagements which justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
to themselves and other settlers called upon them to enforce&mdash;were calculated
to restore tranquillity, and to quiet, for a time at least, the opposition
to their government. The claims under the Indian purchases having been
brought to their notice, and relief sought from the evils to which the claimants
had been subjected, elicited a dignified letter in reply, upholding the
proprietary authority, and presenting in a forcible manner the difficulties
which would inevitably arise should that authority be subverted. In order
to prevent further difficulties from the acquisition of Indian titles by individuals
the right to purchase was continued in the deputy-governor, and
he was directed to make a requisition upon the Proprietors for the necessary
funds, as had been done in 1682, by shipping a cargo of goods valued
at about one hundred and fifty pounds, and expending the amount for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The necessity for the cultivation of good feelings with the Province of
New York was manifest. Having for its chief executive one whose arbitrary
temper and disposition led him to disregard solemn engagements, the
relations between the provinces were not likely to be made more harmonious
because he was heir-apparent to the throne of England; and it was consequently
in accordance both with the principles of the Friends and the
promptings of sound judgment and discretion, that the Proprietors urged
upon Lawrie the propriety of fostering a friendly correspondence with New
York, and avoiding everything that might occasion misapprehension or
cause aggressions upon their rights.</p>

<p>Lawrie conformed himself to the tenor of his instructions. He visited
Governor Dongan and remained with him two or three days, discussing their
mutual rights and privileges, and was treated by him with kindness and
respect; and being of a less grasping disposition than his predecessor, there
were no open acts of hostility to the proprietary government manifested by
him.</p>

<p>Immigration and a transfer of rights soon brought into the Province a
sufficient number of Proprietors to allow of the establishment of a board
of commissioners within its limits, authorized to act with the deputy-governor
in the temporary approval of laws passed by the Assembly, the
purchasing and laying out of lands, and other matters,&mdash;thus avoiding the
necessary and consequent unpleasant delay attendant upon the transmission
of such business details to the Proprietors in England before putting them
in operation. This body was formed August 1, 1684,
and became known as the “Board of Proprietors.”
To this board was intrusted the advancement of a
new town to be called Perth,&mdash;in honor of the Earl
of Perth, one of the Proprietors,&mdash;for the settlement
of which proposals had been issued in 1682, immediately on their obtaining
possession of the Province.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The advancement of this town was a favorite project, and at the time of
Lawrie’s arrival several houses were already erected, and others in progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
(Samuel Groom having surveyed and laid out the site); and attention
was immediately given to the execution of the plans of the projectors,
based upon the expectation that it would become the chief town and seaport
of the Province. Lawrie was particularly cautious, in carrying out
their views as regarded the seaport, not to infringe any of the navigation
laws respecting the payment of duties, or otherwise,&mdash;going so far as to
admit William Dyre, in April, 1685, to the discharge of his duties as collector
of the customs in New Jersey, which naturally led to difficulties. Previously
vessels had been permitted by Lawrie to proceed directly to and from
the Province, and the inhabitants valued the privilege; but Dyre had not been
in execution of his office more than two or three months before he complained
to the commissioners of the customs of the opposition encountered
in enforcing the regulations he had established for entering at New York the
vessels destined to East Jersey, and receiving there the duties upon their
cargoes. This state of affairs continued for some months; for, although the
authorities in England took the subject into consideration, it was not until
April, 1686, that a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> was issued against the Proprietors,&mdash;it
being thought of great prejudice to the country and His Majesty’s interest
that such rights as they claimed should be longer exercised.</p>

<p>James, Duke of York, by the death of Charles II. in May, 1685, had been
raised to the throne of England, and his assumption of royalty simplified
considerably the powers for ignoring all measures conflicting with his private
interests; and although he had thrice as Duke of York, by different
patents and by numerous other documents, confirmed to others all the
rights, powers, and privileges which he himself had obtained, the increased
revenue which was promised him from the reacquisition of New Jersey
could not admit of any hesitancy in adopting measures to effect it. The
Proprietors, however, were firm in their expostulations, and made many
suggestions calculated to remove the pending difficulties; but all were of no
avail except one, looking to the appointment of a collector of the customs
to reside at Perth,&mdash;or Perth Amboy as it began to be called, by the
addition of Amboy, from <i>ambo</i>, an Indian appellation for point. The first
session of the Assembly was held there as the seat of government, April
6, 1686.</p>

<p class="p2">The establishment of a local government in West Jersey in 1677 has been
noticed. The next step toward rendering it more perfect was the election,
by the Proprietors in England, of Edward Byllynge as governor of the
Province, and the appointment by him of Samuel Jenings as his deputy.
These events took place in 1680 and 1681, and Jenings arrived in the Province
to assume the government in September of the latter year, the first
West Jersey Assembly meeting at Burlington in November. The representatives
seem to have had a full sense of the responsibilities resting upon
them, and at once adopted such measures as were deemed essential under
the altered condition of affairs, acknowledging the authority of the deputy-governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
on condition that he should accept certain proposals or fundamentals
of government affixed to the laws they enacted. This Jenings did,
putting his hand and seal thereto; as did also Thomas Olive, the Speaker, by
order and in the name of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Burlington was made the chief town of the Province, and the method of
settling and regulating the lands was relegated to the governor and eight
individuals. For greater convenience the Province was divided into two
districts, the courts of each to be held at Burlington and Salem. The second
Assembly met May 2, 1682, and a four days’ session seems to have been
sufficient to establish the affairs of the Province on a firm basis. Thomas
Olive, Robert Stacy, Mahlon Stacy, William Biddle, Thomas Budd, John
Chaffin, James Nevill, Daniel Wills, Mark Newbie, and Elias Farre being
chosen as the council.</p>

<p>Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in September, and in
May, 1683. At this last some important measures were enacted contributing
to good government. For the despatch of business the governor and council
were authorized to prepare bills for the consideration of the Assembly,
which were to be promulgated twenty days before the meetings of that body.
The governor, council, and assembly were to constitute the General Assembly,
and have definite and decisive action upon all bills so prepared. As
John Fenwicke was one of the representatives to this Assembly, it is evident
that he recognized for his Tenth the general jurisdiction which had been
established. It is understood that Byllynge at this time had resolved to
relieve Jenings from his position, as his own independent authority was
thought to be endangered by Jenings’s continuance in office.</p>

<p>At this Assembly the question was discussed whether the purchase at
first made was of land only or of land and government combined, and the
conclusion arrived at was that both were purchased; and also that an instrument
should be prepared and sent to London, there to be signed by
Byllynge, confirmatory of this view; and, carrying out a suggestion of William
Penn, Samuel Jenings was by vote of the Assembly elected governor
of the Province,&mdash;a proceeding which was satisfactory to the people, as they
desired a continuance of his administration. Thus again did the representatives
of the people assert their claim to entire freedom from all authority
not instituted by themselves.</p>

<p>As Byllynge did not acquiesce as promptly as was desired with the views
of the Assembly, it was determined at a session held in March, 1684, that,
for the vindication of the people’s right to government, Governor Jenings
and Thomas Budd (George Hutchinson subsequently acted with them)
should go to England and discuss the matter with Byllynge in person,&mdash;Thomas
Olive being appointed deputy-governor until the next Assembly
should meet. This was in the May following, at which time Olive was
elected governor, and his council made to consist of Robert Stacy, William
Biddle, Robert Dusdale, John Gosling, Elias Farre, Daniel Wills, Richard
Guy, Robert Turner, William Emley and Christopher White.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>The mission of Jenings was only partially successful. The differences between
Byllynge and the people were referred to the “judgment and determination”
of George Fox, George Whitehead, and twelve other prominent
Friends; whose award was to the effect that the government was rightfully
in Byllynge, and that they could not find any authority for a governor
chosen by the people. This award was made in October, 1684, but was
signed by only eight of the fourteen referees, George Fox not being one of
them. The document subsequently became the cause of much discussion.
As late as 1699 it was printed with the addition of many severe reflections
upon the action of Jenings and his friends, drawing from him equally harsh
animadversions upon those from whom they emanated. In accordance with
this award Byllynge asserted his claims to the chief authority over the
Province, and no important concessions appear to have been made to the
people.</p>

<p>In 1685 Byllynge appointed John Skene to be his deputy-governor; and
on September 25 the Assembly, expressly reserving “their just rights and
privileges,” recognized him as such, Olive continuing to act as chairman, or
speaker, of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Harmony to a great extent prevailed for some time, Skene not attempting
to exercise any authority not generally acknowledged by the people;
but in 1687 Byllynge died, and Dr. Daniel Coxe of London, already a
large proprietor, having purchased the whole of Byllynge’s interest from
his heirs, after consultation with the principal Proprietors in England, decided
to assume the government of the Province himself. But while he
thus assumed, in his own person, rights which the people had claimed as
theirs, he did not refrain from granting to them a liberal exercise of power,
giving assurances that all reasonable expectations and requests would be
complied with, and that the officers who had been chosen by the people
should be continued in their several positions. It is somewhat more than
doubtful if Coxe ever visited the Province at all, and indeed he probably
did not; meanwhile Byllynge’s deputy, John Skene, acted for him till
the death of the latter in December, 1687, when Coxe appointed Edward
Hunloke in his stead.</p>

<p class="p2">It was during Lawrie’s administration in East Jersey that the first steps
were taken to settle the boundary line between that Province and New York.
The subject was discussed by him and Governor Dongan at an early date;
and on June 30, 1686, a council was held, composed of the two deputy-governors
and several gentlemen of both New York and New Jersey, at which
the course to be pursued in running the line was agreed upon. The points
on the Hudson and Delaware rivers were subsequently determined; but
nothing further was done for several years, and nearly a century elapsed
before the line was definitely settled.</p>

<p>There are some allusions made to the fact that Lawrie was much interested
in West Jersey, as accounting for his dismissal by the Proprietors from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
his position as their deputy-governor in East Jersey; but so far as the records
of the period give an insight into the motives actuating him in the administration
of the affairs of the Province, there is no evidence afforded of
any want of interest in its prosperity. As the result of his administration did
not meet their expectations of profit, it is not surprising that they should have
regarded it as due to some mistaken policy on his part. In the appointment
of a successor they were evidently led by the large influx of population
from Scotland to look among the Proprietors residing there for a suitable
person; and they therefore selected Lord Neill Campbell, a brother of the
Earl of Argyle, who was obliged to flee from Scotland in consequence of
his connection with that nobleman, who had been beheaded June 30, 1685,
after the unfortunate termination of his invasion of that country. He left
for East Jersey with a large number of emigrants not long after that event,
and reached the Province in December of the same year.</p>

<p>Lord Neill was appointed deputy-governor June 2, 1686, for two years,
but his commission did not reach him until October, on the 5th of which
month it was published; and on the 18th he announced as his council
Gawen Lawrie, John Berry of Bergen, Isaac Kingsland of New Barbadoes,
Andrew Hamilton of Amboy, Richard Townley of Elizabethtown, Samuel
Winder of Cheesequakes, David Mudie and John Johnstone of Amboy, and
Thomas Codrington of Raritan.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance that the great diversity existing in the
characters, religions, pursuits, and political relations of the Proprietors of
East Jersey should have been overcome to such an extent as to allow of
harmonious action in the appointment of Lord Neill Campbell. The Earl
of Perth, a prominent member of the body, was one of the jury that found
the Earl of Argyle guilty of high treason; and yet, stanch adherent as he
was of James, he could consent to have his interests in East Jersey taken
care of by that earl’s brother. Robert Barclay, with all the peculiarities
of his peaceful sect, the advocate of gentleness and non-resistance, was
willing to be associated with a stanch Scotch Presbyterian soldier, and join
in commissioning him as his subordinate. It is evident that private prejudices
and feelings were not allowed to interfere with whatever was thought
likely to conduce to the advancement of their pecuniary interests in East
Jersey.</p>

<p>Lord Neill’s administration, however, was very brief. On December 10
of the same year, “urgent necessity of some weighty matters” calling him
to England, he appointed Andrew Hamilton to be his substitute, and sailed,
it is presumed, the March following, Hamilton’s commission being published
on the 12th of that month.</p>

<p>Andrew Hamilton had been a merchant in London, and came to the
Province with his family in June, 1686, as an agent of the Proprietors in
London. He at first declined accepting the position tendered him, and
Lawrie, who was one of the council, openly protested against his appointment,
because of his unpopularity with the planters; but his authority having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
been confirmed by a commission from Governor Barclay in August, 1687,
all open opposition thereto seems to have ceased. Hamilton appears to
have been a man of intelligence, and to have acted in a manner which he
conceived to be calculated to advance the best interests of the Proprietors
without involving them with the people, but it is doubtful if any great cordiality
existed between the governor and the governed at that period.</p>

<p>Before his death Charles II. had been led to call for a surrender of the
charter of Massachusetts Bay, and, meeting with a refusal from the General
Assembly, a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> was issued in 1684. The death of
the King left the proceedings to be consummated by his successor, whose
rapacity prompted him to subvert the liberties of all the colonies; and his
pliant servant Andros, whom he had knighted, was sent over with a commission
that covered all New England. Sir Edmund took up his residence
in Boston, assumed the supreme authority of Massachusetts, and the following
year dissolved in succession the governments of Rhode Island and
Connecticut, taking to himself all power and dominion, even beyond the
limits granted by his royal master.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>The Proprietors, finding it impossible to overcome the determination of
James to unite New York and New Jersey to New England under the same
government, deemed it advisable to abandon the unavailing contest, and
by acceding to the King’s design to obtain from him an efficient guarantee
that he would respect their rights to the soil. A surrender of their patent,
so far as the government was concerned, was therefore made in April, 1688,
James having agreed to accept it; and, the Proprietors of West Jersey having
acceded also to the arrangement, a new commission was issued to Sir
Edmund Andros, annexing both provinces and New York to his government,
and Francis Nicholson was appointed his lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>The course of Andros in accepting the simple acknowledgment of his
authority as sufficient, without revolutionizing the government and dismissing
the functionaries in office in New Jersey, was doubtless in a great measure
owing to the fact that the surrender by the Proprietors of their right
to govern rendered necessary the issuing of a new grant to them from the
Crown, confirmatory of all the immunities of the soil; and until that could
be perfected, it may have been considered expedient not to disturb the existing
regulations. It is nevertheless remarkable that any considerations of
the kind should have had so mollifying an effect upon one whose arrogance,
disregard of the rights of others, and impetuosity of temper were so intrusively
manifest as in Edmund Andros.</p>

<p>By the seizure of Andros in New England in April, 1689, in anticipation
of the successful revolution in England in favor of William and Mary, which
promised the subversion of his authority not only there but also in the
other colonies that had been placed within his jurisdiction, an opportunity
was afforded the Proprietors of New Jersey to resume all the rights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
privileges of which they had been despoiled. But there were impediments
in the way. They were not sure of the support of the people, and being
separated,&mdash;some in England, some in Scotland, and some in New Jersey,&mdash;it
was not possible that unanimity of action could be secured. Many of
them, having been closely allied to King James, were probably disposed to
cling to him in his misfortunes, and had the deputy-governor thrown off
the responsibilities he had so recently resumed as the representative of the
Crown, for the purpose of re-establishing the authority of the Proprietors,
it would have been attended with great doubt and uncertainty as to his success,
the people having so definitely manifested their preference for a royal
government.</p>

<p>In April Hamilton received a summons from the mayor of New York,
acting as lieutenant of Andros; and, attended by the justices of Bergen,
repaired thither to consult upon the proper course to be pursued in the
peculiar situation of affairs prevailing in the two colonies, but nothing of
consequence resulted from the conference. The deputy-governor on subsequent
occasions was invited to similar consultations in New York, but
does not seem to have compromised himself in any way with any party;
and, as so much doubt existed as to what was the proper course for him
to pursue, he resolved in August to proceed to England in person to advise
with the Proprietors there. On his way thither he was taken prisoner by
the French, and appears to have been detained in France until the May
following, when he, being then in England, resigned his position as the
deputy-governor. From the time of Hamilton’s departure for England
until 1692 the inhabitants of East Jersey were left to the guardianship of
their county and town officers, who seemed to have possessed all necessary
powers to preserve the peace. So also in West Jersey. The course of
events caused but little alteration in the general condition of the Province
after the surrender of the government to Andros in April, 1688, and the
subsequent suspension of his authority.</p>

<p>In 1687 George Keith, surveyor-general of East Jersey, under orders
from the Proprietors there, attempted to run the dividing line between the
two provinces, in accordance with the terms of the Quintipartite deed of
1676; but the result was unsatisfactory to West Jersey, as it was thought
too great a quantity of the best lands came thereby within the bounds of
East Jersey. In September, 1688, however, a consultation took place in
London, between Governor Coxe of West Jersey and Governor Barclay of
East Jersey, with the view of perfecting a settlement of Keith’s line, resulting
in a written agreement signed and sealed by the two parties; but nevertheless
no satisfactory termination of the matter was arrived at for many
years. It was in 1688 that the “Board of Proprietors of West Jersey”
was regularly organized.</p>

<p class="p2">It would be very gratifying to be able to state clearly, upon good authority,
the condition of New Jersey at this eventful period in its history, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
note its progress since its surrender to the English in 1664, but from the
imperfection of the details, the information obtainable is not sufficiently
definite to give satisfactory results.</p>

<p>That the population of East Jersey had largely increased there can be no
doubt. It was a constant cause of complaint by the government of New
York that the freedom from taxation and various mercantile restrictions had
tended greatly to increase emigration to East Jersey, much to the detriment
of New York; and the first towns, Newark, Elizabethtown, and Middletown,
drew large numbers from New England and Long Island, leading to
their becoming centres for the development of other towns and villages.
The new capital, Perth Amboy, became in a very few years an important
settlement, and both from Scotland and England numerous families had
already arrived and settled in various parts of the Province; so that it is
probable the increase during the quarter of a century had been more than
a hundred-fold, making the total number of souls in East Jersey nearly, if
not quite, ten thousand. There are no figures upon which any correct
estimate can be based of the increase in West Jersey, but it may be safely
considered as coming far short of the eastern Province.</p>

<p>Of the five counties recognized in 1670 Monmouth was the most populous;
and of its three towns, Shrewsbury, Middletown, and Freehold, the
first was the most important. Essex County came next; Elizabethtown,
Newark, Acquackanock, and New Barbadoes being its towns, ranking in the
order in which they are named. Middlesex followed, with Woodbridge,
Piscataway, and Perth Amboy as its towns. Bergen stood fourth, with
its towns of Bergen and Hackensack; and Somerset came last, having
no specific townships. There were, of course, in all the counties small
settlements not yet of sufficient importance to be recognized as separate
organizations. In 1683 Bergen County was third in importance, and Middlesex
fourth.</p>

<p>One great hindrance to the development of the agricultural and mineral
resources of the two provinces was the want of roads and conveniences to
promote intercourse between the different sections. The only Indian path
ran from Shrewsbury River to the northwest limits of the Province, and the
only road opened by the Dutch appears to have been that by which intercourse
was kept up with the settlements on the Delaware, in what is now
Maryland. From New Amsterdam a direct water communication was had
with Elizabethtown Point (now Elizabethport), and thence by land to the
Raritan River which was crossed by fording at Inian’s Ferry, now New
Brunswick. Thence the road ran in almost a straight course to the Delaware
River, above the site of the present Trenton, where there was another
ford. This was called the Upper Road; another, called the Lower Road,
branched off from the first about five or six miles from the Raritan, and by
a circuitous route reached the Delaware at the site of what is now Burlington;
but the whole country was a wilderness between the towns in Monmouth
County and the Delaware River as late as 1675.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>The first public measures for the establishment of roads was in 1675;
two men in each town being clothed with authority to lay out the common
highways; and in March, 1683, boards were created in the different counties
to lay out all necessary highways, bridges, landings, ferries, etc., and by
these boards the first effective intercommunication was established. The
present generation have in constant use many of the roads laid out by them.
In July, 1683, instructions were given to Deputy-Governor Lawrie to open a
road between the new capital, Perthtown, and Burlington; but, although his
instructions were complied with, and the road opened in connection with
water communication between Perth and New York, the route by way
of New Brunswick was the most travelled.</p>

<p>The character of the legislation and laws for the punishment and suppression
of crime was very different in the two provinces. The penal
laws in East Jersey partook more of the severity of the Levitical law, originating
as they did with the settlers coming from Puritan countries, while
those in West Jersey were exceedingly humane and forbearing. In the one
there were thirteen classes of offences made amenable to the death penalty,
while in the other such a punishment was unknown to the laws.</p>

<p>As might reasonably be expected from its proximity to New Amsterdam,
the first church erected in New Jersey soil, of which any mention is
made, was at Bergen. This was in 1680, the congregation having been
formed in 1662. The first clergyman heard of in Newark was in 1667, a
Congregationalist, and the first meeting-house was built in 1669. Elizabethtown’s
first congregation was formed in 1668. Woodbridge succeeded in
getting one established in 1670, and its first church was built in 1681. The
Quakers immediately after their arrival in West Jersey, in 1675, organized
a meeting at Salem (probably the one which Edmondson says he
attended), and in 1680 purchased a house and had it fitted up for their
religious services. It is said that the first religious meetings of the Quakers
in New Jersey were held at Shrewsbury as early as 1670, the settlers there,
about 1667, being principally of that denomination. Edmondson mentions
a meeting held at Middletown in 1675. The first General Yearly Meeting
for regulating the affairs of the Society was held at Burlington in August,
1681. Local meetings were held there in tents before a house was erected.
John Woolston’s was the first, and its walls were consecrated by having
worship within them. The Friends at Cape May in 1676, Cohansey in 1683,
and Lower Alloway Creek in 1685 secured religious services.</p>

<p>Middletown, in Monmouth County, had an organized Baptist congregation
in 1688; and Piscataway in Middlesex County one in 1689.</p>

<p>To what extent education had been fostered up to this period it is difficult
to determine. The first schoolmaster mentioned in Newark was there
in 1676; but Bergen had a school established under the Dutch administration
in 1661. The first general law providing for the establishment and
support of school-masters in East Jersey was not passed until 1693.</p>

<p>The currency of both East and West Jersey during the whole period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
their colonial existence, for reasons which are not very apparent, was more
stable than that of the neighboring colonies. The coins of England and
Holland, and their respective moneys of account, were used, and Indian
wampum afforded the means of exchange with the Aborigines. Barter was
naturally the mode of traffic most followed, and tables are now found showing
the value set upon the different productions of the soil that were used
in these business operations, marking the diminution in value from year to
year as compared with “old England money.” In 1681 an act was passed
in West Jersey for the enhancing, or raising, the value of coins, which was
extended also to New England money. About that time an individual,
named Mark Newbie, increased the circulating medium by putting into circulation
a large number of Irish half-pence of less value than the standard coin,
which he had brought with him from Ireland; and, as thought by some, continued
the manufacture of them after his arrival. The act of 1681, however,
was repealed the following year, and another passed making Newbie’s half-pence
equal in value to the current money of the Province, provided he gave
security to exchange them “for pay equivalent on demand,” and provided also
that no person should be obliged to take more than five shillings on one payment.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
No repeal of this act appears in the records. It became inoperative
probably in 1684, when Newbie disappears from the documentary history of
the period. This supposition is in some measure confirmed by the passage
of an act in May of that year, making three farthings “of the King’s coin to
go current for one penny,” in sums not exceeding five shillings.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>The only attempt to regulate the value of gold and silver in East Jersey
was in 1686. Its object was to prevent the transportation of silver from the
Province by raising it above its true value in all business transactions. Its
evil tendencies, however, were soon developed, and before the end of the
year, at a subsequent session of the same Assembly, it was repealed.</p>

<p>The first grist-mill is mentioned in 1671, and was followed by another in
1679, hand-mills being generally used. The first saw-mill was erected in
1682. In 1683 Deputy-Governor Rudyard, in a letter to a friend, says
that at that time there were two saw-mills at work, and five or six more
projected, abating “the price of boards half in half, and all other timber
for building; for altho’ timber cost nothing, yet workmanship by hand
was London price or near upon it, and sometimes more, which these mills
abate.”</p>

<p>The cider produced at Newark was awarded the preference over that
brought from New England, Rhode Island, or Long Island. Clams, oysters,
and fish received well merited commendation for their plentifulness
and good qualities.</p>

<p>In 1685 the iron-mills in Monmouth County, belonging to Lewis
Morris, were in full operation; but it was not until some years had elapsed
that “the hills up in the country,” which were “said to be stony,” were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
explored, and the mineral treasures of Morris County revealed. Gabriel
Thomas, in 1698, mentions rice among the products of West Jersey, adding
that large quantities of pitch, tar, and turpentine were secured from the
pine forests, and that the number of whales caught yearly gave the settlers
abundance of oil and whalebone.</p>

<h3><a name="c449" id="c449">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE relations existing between New York and New Jersey, during the era of discovery
and settlement, necessarily led to their being jointly noticed by all the early writers,
and as they have been referred to in what has preceded this chapter,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> it is thought unnecessary
to comment further upon their revelations. Attention will therefore be given to
those whose object was the making known the peculiarities, the advantages, and attractions
of New Jersey independent of New York.</p>

<p>The first of these was an issue by John Fenwicke of a single folio leaf, in 1675, containing
his proposals for planting his colony of New Cæsarea, or New Jersey. A copy
was for sale in London in 1853,&mdash;perhaps the same copy sold at the Brinley sale to the
Pennsylvania Historical Society. It is printed in <i>Penn. Mag. of Hist.</i>, vi.</p>

<p>In 1682 the Proprietors of East Jersey published a small quarto of eight pages, giving
an account of their recently acquired province.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> This publication is not now obtainable,
and it is doubtful if any copies have been seen for several generations. It is the basis of
all the information respecting East Jersey contained in <i>The Present State of His Majesty’s
Isles and Territories in America</i>, etc., by Richard Blome (London, 1687), which is frequently
quoted, though abounding in errors. Although the original edition may not now
be met with, the <i>Brief Account</i> may be found reprinted in Smith’s <i>History of New Jersey</i>,
and in <i>East Jersey under the Proprietary Governments</i>. It gives a very fair and interesting
account of the Province, and doubtless aided in inducing adventurers to embark for
the new Eldorado.</p>

<p>In 1683 a small quarto of fifteen pages, including the titlepage, was published in Edinburgh
for the Scotch Proprietors, of similar purport to the foregoing.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> The only copy of
the original, known, is in the possession of Samuel L. M. Barlow, Esq., of New York. This
was used when the work was reproduced in the New York <i>Historical Magazine</i>, second
series, vol. i.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>In 1684 a work of greater pretensions, comprising 73 pages, 12º, was published in
London, entitled <i>The Planter’s Speech to his neighbours and countrymen of Pennsylvania,
East and West Jersey; and to all such as have transported themselves into new Colonies
for the sake of a quiet, retired life. To which is added the complaints of our Supra-interior
inhabitants</i>. The title and introduction of this volume are all that have been met
with. They will be found in Proud’s <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The author’s name is
not known, but it would seem that his object was more to impress upon his “dear friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
and countrymen” their moral and religious duties as immigrants, than to portray the advantages
of the section of country particularly referred to.</p>

<p>The purport of the treatise is thus summarized by Proud: “Divers particulars are
proposed as fundamentals for future laws and customs, tending principally to establish a
higher degree of temperance and original simplicity of manners,&mdash;more particularly against
the use of spirituous liquors,&mdash;than had been usual before. Everything of a military nature,
even the use of the instruments thereof, is not only disapproved, and the destruction
of the human species thereby condemned in this <i>Speech</i>, but likewise all violence or cruelty
towards, and the wanton killing of, the inferior living creatures, and the eating of animal
food are also strongly advised against in those proposed regulations, customs, or laws, with
the reasons given, etc., to the end that a higher degree of love, perfection, and happiness
might more universally be introduced and preserved among mankind.”</p>

<p>In 1685 the most interesting and valuable of all the early publications was issued in
Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> reference to which has been made on a preceding page. The author, George
Scot, of Pitlochie, was connected by descent and marriage with many distinguished families
in Scotland, which connection probably led the Proprietors to confide the preparation
of the work to him, as his extensive circle of friends and acquaintances would be likely
to insure for it a more general acceptance, particularly as he was ready to add example to
precept by embarking himself and family for East Jersey. Accompanied by nearly two
hundred persons, he sailed from Scotland about Aug. 1, 1685, but before the vessel reached
her destination Scot and his wife and many of their fellow-passengers were no longer
living. One daughter, Eupham, became the wife of John Johnstone the ensuing year.
Mr. Johnstone was one of her fellow-passengers. Their descendants became numerous,
and for years before the war of Independence, and since that period, they filled high civil
and military stations in East Jersey.</p>

<p>The author of <i>The Model</i> begins his work with a learned disquisition upon the manner
in which America was first peopled, and then proceeds to meet and overcome the various
scruples that were presumed to operate against its further settlement from Scotland, by
arguments drawn from sacred and profane history and from the consideration due their
families and the country; concluding with a portrayal of the advantages to be secured by
a residence in East Jersey, and the superiority of that colony over others in America and
the West Indies. In this respect the value of the work to the historian is very great, as
numerous letters are given from the early settlers, presenting minute descriptions of various
localities and their individual experiences in a manner calculated to produce a correct
and, at the same time, a favorable impression upon their readers. The original edition
is exceedingly rare, only ten copies being known, but the New Jersey Historical Society
has caused it to be reprinted as an appendix to the first volume of its <i>Collections</i>, thus
placing it within the reach of all.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The year 1685 gave also to the world the interesting book of Thomas Budd, entitled
<i>Good Order established in Pennsilvania and New Jersey</i>.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Mr. Budd arrived at Burlington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
in West Jersey, in 1678, and during his residence there held many important offices;
was associated with Jenings on the committee appointed in 1684 to confer with Edward
Byllynge, and it was while he was in England that his book was printed. He probably
removed to Philadelphia after his return to New Jersey. He made another brief visit to
England in 1689, but continued to consider Philadelphia as his residence until his death
in 1698. Mr. Budd’s work exhibits the possession of intelligence and public spirit to a
remarkable degree. Some of his suggestions as to the education which should be given
to the young in various pursuits show him to have been an early advocate of what are now
termed Technical Schools, and are deserving of consideration even at this late day. The
original work is seldom seen, but in 1865 a reprint was given to the public by William
Gowans, of New York, having an introduction and copious notes by Mr. Edward Armstrong,
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In 1698 Gabriel Thomas published a small octavo of forty-six pages on West Jersey, in
connection with a similar work on Pennsylvania, with a map of both colonies. He was
then, it is thought, a resident of London, but he had resided in America about fifteen
years, the information contained in the book being the result of his own experiences and
observation.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> The book was dedicated to the West Jersey Proprietors, and its intent was
to induce emigration of all who wished to better their worldly condition, especially the
poor, who might in West Jersey “subsist very well without either begging or stealing.”
French refugees or Protestants would find it also to their interest to remove thither where
they might live “far better than in Germany, Holland, Ireland, or England.” The modes
of life among the Indians, and the prevailing intercourse between them and the settlers
were fully discussed, as well as the natural productions of the country and the improvements
already introduced or in progress.</p>

<p>In 1699 two pamphlets were published in Philadelphia, referring to the difficulties in
West Jersey between the people of the Province and Edward Byllynge in 1684, which led
to the despatch, by the Assembly, of Samuel Jenings and Thomas Budd to confer in person
with Byllynge. The first of these publications was aimed at Jenings, who was accused
of being the head of “some West Jersians” opposed to Byllynge, and emanated from
John Tatham, Thomas Revell, and Nathaniel Westland, although published anonymously.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
Jenings took exceptions to many of its statements and answered it under his own name in
a small quarto, boldly asserting his innocence of the serious charges made against him.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
These publications throw considerable light upon a portion of West Jersey history which is
very obscure, and have been used in the preparation of the foregoing narrative. They are
both exceedingly rare, and historians are indebted to Mr. Brinton Coxe, of Philadelphia,
for having them reprinted in 1881.</p>

<p>The Journal of William Edmundson has been referred to as furnishing some interesting
items respecting New Jersey during the period we have had under review.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> He visited
the Province in 1676, and his statements respecting the condition of the country and
his interviews with prominent Friends are valuable.</p>

<p>In addition to these publications, there are in the Secretary of State’s office at Trenton
the original records of both the East Jersey and West Jersey Proprietors, which were
transferred from Perth Amboy and Burlington about the middle of the last century, copies
only being left in the original places of deposit.</p>

<p>The foregoing references include all the works published, prior to the surrender of the
government of New Jersey to the Crown in 1703, relating to the history of the Province,
previous to its separation from New York; but others were published subsequently which
throw much light upon that early period, although not written for that purpose exclusively.
Thus in 1747 the renowned Elizabethtown Bill in Chancery was drawn and put in print by
subscription the same year,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> which will ever be acknowledged as a structure of valuable
materials illustrative of the conflicts between the Proprietors and their government and
the discontented settlers. The bill was principally drawn by James Alexander, who during
a long period was a prominent lawyer in both provinces. A Scotchman by birth he
came to America in 1715, and shortly after his arrival entered the Secretary’s office, New
York, and was deputy-clerk of the Court in 1719. Throughout his life, which did not
terminate until April 2, 1756, he held very highly important positions in both New York
and New Jersey, and was the owner of large land tracts in both provinces.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> This bill,
notwithstanding its great length and complicated nature, is drawn with much ability and
makes out a very strong case for the plaintiffs. The defendants’ claims would seem to be,
beyond controversy, invalid; but other matters were introduced rendering the case one
not easily disposed of.</p>

<p>The answer to the Bill in Chancery was filed in 1751 and printed in 1752,&mdash;the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
for the defendants being William Livingston, afterward Governor of New Jersey, and William
Smith, Jr., who became Chief-Justice of New York, and subsequently, after the war
of Independence, Chief-Justice of Canada. The copies now extant are very rare.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Although
not as voluminous it was fully as prolix as the document which prompted it. Notwithstanding
the great amount of labor which this case required both in its preparation
and argument, it was never brought to a conclusion. The Revolution of 1776 effectually
interrupted the progress of the suit, and it was never afterward revived. Both bill and
answer, however, and other smaller publications which resulted from the trial of the case,
must ever be considered as valuable historical documents, emanating as they all did from
parties more or less interested in the questions involved, and consequently earnestly desirous
of eliciting every fact that could throw any light upon them.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>The first general history of New Jersey was that of Samuel Smith, published in 1765.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
It is valuable to all examining the early history of the State, from the author’s having had
access to, and judiciously used, information obtained from various sources not now accessible.
He gives some interesting letters from early settlers, elucidating the events comprehended
in the period we have had under review; and although, as might naturally be
expected, errors are occasionally found in it, Smith’s <i>History of New Jersey</i> has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
been deservedly considered a standard work.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Proud, whose <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>
contains much matter referring to West Jersey that is usefully arranged, acknowledges his
indebtedness to Smith, and gives him the credit of being “the person who took the most
pains to adjust and reduce these materials into nice order, as might be proper for the
public view,” previous to his own undertaking; and the old historian, if cognizant of what
is taking place in his native State at this late day, must be gratified to find how freely modern
writers have transferred his pages to their books, even though no acknowledgment of
indebtedness to him has been made.</p>

<p>In 1748 the acts of the General Assembly of New Jersey, from the time of the surrender
of the government to the Crown in the second year of Queen Anne, were published
under the supervision of Samuel Nevill, second Judge of the Supreme Court of the Province,
and, in consequence, the popular party were aroused into having the early grants and
concessions also arranged and published. About 1750 a committee was appointed to collate
the early manuscripts connected with the proprietary grants, and subsequently Aaron
Leaming and Jacob Spicer were empowered to have them printed, and to them does the
credit belong of giving to their fellow-citizens the admirable compilation that is generally
quoted under their names.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> It contains all the agreements, deeds, concessions, and public
acts from 1664 to 1702, and the object in view by their compilation and the estimate in
which they were held are apparent from a remark of the compilers in their preface. “If
our present system of government,” say they, “should not be judged so equal to the natural
rights of a reasonable creature as the one that raised us to the dignity of a colony, let
it serve as a caution to guard the cause of liberty.”</p>

<p>This volume has been of great value to members of the Bar and of the Legislature, as
well as to the historian, as it has preserved many documents the original depository of
which is not now to be found.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> At the present time, however, the State of New Jersey is
publishing, under the direction of a committee of the Historical Society, a series of volumes
entitled the <i>New Jersey Archives</i>, which is intended to include all important documents
referring to the colonial history of the State, however widely the originals may be
scattered in other depositories,&mdash;including all of interest now preserved in the Public Record
Office of England,&mdash;and will probably be the authoritative reference hereafter for
documentary evidence relating to the whole colonial period.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>The first volume issued by the New Jersey Historical Society as their Collections was
published in 1846, and contained “East Jersey under the Proprietary Governments.”<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
The author wrote his work fully sensible of the necessity for verifying much that had been
allowed to pass as history, by seeking for and using original sources of information; and
the volume elucidates many events that are alluded to in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="c455" id="c455">Editorial Note</a></span>.&mdash;The <i>New Jersey Archives</i>
will contain every essential document
noted in <i>An Analytical Index to the Colonial Documents
of New Jersey in the state-paper offices of
England, compiled by Henry Stevens, edited with
notes and references to printed works and manuscripts
in other depositories</i>, by William A. Whitehead,
New York, 1858.</p>

<p>In 1843 a movement was made in the State
Legislature to emulate the action of New York
in securing from the English Archives copies
of its early historical documents; and in the next
year the judiciary committee made a report on
the subject, which is printed in the preface of
this Index, p. vii. This, however, failed of effect,
as did a movement in 1845; but it made manifest
the necessity of an historical society, as a source
of influence for such end; and the same year the
New Jersey Historical Society was formed, of
which Mr. Whitehead has been the corresponding
secretary from the start. This society reinforced
the movement in the State Legislature;
but no result being reached, it undertook of its
own action the desired work, and in 1849 gave a
commission to Mr. Henry Stevens to make an analytical
index of the documents relating to New
Jersey to be found in England. This being furnished,
the State legislature failing to respond in
any co-operative measures for the enlargement
of it from the domestic records of the State, Mr.
Whitehead undertook the editing, as explained
in the title, and appended to the volume a bibliography
of all the principal printed works relating to
New Jersey up to 1857. Mr. Stevens’s enumeration
began with 1663-64, the editor adding two
earlier ones of 1649 and 1651. But a small part
of the list, however (13 pp. out of 470), refers
to the period covered by the present chapter,
and many of those mentioned had already been
printed.</p>

<p>The <i>Sparks Catalogue</i> shows “Papers relating
to New Jersey, 1683-1775,” collected by
George Chalmers, which are now in Harvard
College Library.</p>

<p>Some of the later general histories of the
State may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The History of New Jersey from its Discovery
to the Adoption of the Federal Constitution</i>, by
Thomas F. Gordon, Trenton, 1834. There is a
companion volume, a Gazetteer.</p>

<p><i>Civil and Political History of New Jersey</i>, by
Isaac S. Mulford, Camden, 1848. The author
says “no claim is advanced for originality or
learning,” his object being to make accessible
scattered information in a “simple and compendious
narrative,” which is not altogether carefully
set forth. A new edition was issued in
1851 in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><i>The History of New Jersey</i>, by John O. Raum,
2 vols. Philadelphia, 1877, is simply, so far as
the early chronicles are concerned, a repetition
mostly of Smith and Gordon, though no credit
is given to those authorities.</p>

<p>A few of the local histories also deserve some
notice:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Contributions to the Early History of Perth
Amboy and adjoining Country</i>, by William A.
Whitehead, New York, 1856. The author says,
“No attempt has been made to clothe with the
importance of history these desultory gleanings.”
It has a map of the original laying-out, following
what is presumed to have been an original survey
of 1684.</p>

<p><i>An Historical Account of the First Settlement

<p>The two hundredth anniversary

the writer of the present chapter

<p><i>The History of Newark,

<p class="p2">The annexed sketch-map
is an extract from a
map entitled, <i>Le Canada,
ou Nouvelle France, etc.,
par N. Sanson d’Abbeville,
geographe ordinaire du Roy</i>,
Paris, 1656, and by its dotted lines
shows the limits conceded by the
French to the different colonies of
the northern seaboard of the present
United States, a few years
before the establishment of New
Caesaria. New England was defined
on the east by the height of
land between the waters of the
Penobscot and the Kennebec, and
on the northwest by a similar elevation
that turned the rainfall to
the St. Lawrence. New Netherland
stretched from Cape Cod to the Delaware,
where it met New Sweden, which lay between
it and Virginia,&mdash;the Maryland charter not being
recognized; nor was the absorption of the
territory of the Swedes the year before (1655),
by the Dutch, made note of. The map-maker,
in defining these limits, pretends to have worked
on English and Dutch authorities; but the Plymouth
colonists would have hardly allowed the
annihilation to which they were subjected, and
the settlers of Massachusetts would scarcely
have recognized the names attached to their
headlands and harbors, and never having any
existence but in Smith’s map, which the royal
geographer seems to have fallen in with.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GREGORY B. KEEN.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Late Professor of Mathematics in the Theological Seminary of St. Charles Borromeo, Corresponding Secretary of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE English did not attain supreme dominion in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
or Delaware until the grant of King Charles II. to his royal brother, the Duke
of York, in 1664; yet the history of these States and that of Maryland would not be complete
without specific mention of the antecedent attempt to settle this part of America,
made by the unsuccessful colonist Sir Edmund Plowden.</p>

<p>This person was a member of a Saxon family of Shropshire, England, whose antiquity
is sufficiently intimated by the meaning of its surname, “Kill-Dane,”&mdash;being the second
son of Francis Plowden, Esq., of Plowden, Salop, and grandson of the celebrated lawyer
and author of the <i>Commentaries</i>, Serjeant Edmund Plowden, a Catholic, who declined
the Lord-Chancellorship of England, offered him by Queen Elizabeth, lest he should be
forced to countenance her Majesty’s persecutions of his Church.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> In 1632, this gentleman,
who like his ancestors and other relatives was a Catholic,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and at that time resided in
Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> in company with “Sir John Lawrence, Kt. and Bart., Sir Boyer Worsley, Kt.,
John Trusler, Roger Pack, William Inwood, Thomas Ryebread, Charles Barret, and
George Noble, adventurers,” petitioned King Charles I. for a patent, under his Majesty’s
seal of Ireland, for “Manitie, or Long Isle,” and “thirty miles square of the coast next
adjoining, to be erected into a County Palatine called Syon, to be held of” his “Majesty’s
Crown of Ireland, without appeal or subjection to the Governor or Company of Virginia,
and reserving the fifth of all royal mines, and with the like title, dignity, and privileges to
Sir Edmund Plowden there as was granted to Sir George Calvert, Kt., in New Foundland
by” his “Majesty’s royal father, and with the usual grants and privileges to other colonies,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
etc. And a modified form of this prayer was subsequently presented to the monarch,
in which the island spoken of is called “Isle Plowden,” and the county palatine
“New Albion,” and the latter is enlarged to include “forty leagues square of the adjoining
continent,” the supplicants “promising therein to settle five hundred inhabitants for the
planting and civilizing thereof.” The favor sought was immediately conceded, and the
King’s warrant, authorizing the issue of a patent to the petitioners, and appointing Sir
Edmund Plowden “first Governor of the Premises,” was given at Oatlands, July 24, the
same year;<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> in accordance with which, a charter was granted to Plowden and his associates
above mentioned, by writ of Privy Seal, witnessed by the Deputy-General of Ireland, at
Dublin, June 21, 1634.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> In this document the boundaries of New Albion are so defined
as to include all of New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania embraced in a
square, the eastern side of which, forty leagues in length, extended (along the coast) from
Sandy Hook to Cape May, together with Long Island, and all other “isles and islands in
the sea within ten leagues of the shores of the said region.” The province is expressly
erected into a county palatine, under the jurisdiction of Sir Edmund Plowden as earl,
depending upon his Majesty’s “royal person and imperial crown, as King of Ireland;”
and the same extraordinary privileges are conferred upon the patentee as had been
bestowed two years before upon Lord Baltimore, to whose charter for Maryland that
for New Albion bears very close resemblance.</p>

<p>Two of the petitioners, Worsley and Barret, afterward dying, “the whole estate and
interest” in the grant became vested in the seven survivors, and of these, Ryebread, Pack,
Inwood, and Trusler, in consideration of gifts of five hundred acres of land in the province,
abandoned their claims, Dec. 20, 1634, in favor of “Francis, Lord Plowden, son and
heir of Sir Edmund, Earl Palatine,” and George and Thomas Plowden, two other of his
sons, their heirs and assigns, forever. The same year, apparently,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Plowden granted to
Sir Thomas Danby a lease of ten thousand acres of land, one hundred of which were “on
the northeast end or cape of Long Island,” and the rest in the vicinity of Watsessett, presumed
to be near the present Salem, New Jersey, with “full liberty and jurisdiction of a
court baron and court leet,” and other privileges for a “Town and Manor of Danby Fort,”
conditioned on the settlement of one hundred “resident planters in the province,” not
suffering “any to live therein not believing or professing
the three Christian creeds commonly called the
Apostolical, Athanasian, and Nicene.”</p>

<p>The plans of the Earl Palatine were simultaneously
advanced by the independent voyages of Captain
Thomas Yong, of a Yorkshire family, and his
nephew and lieutenant, Robert Evelin, of Wotton, Surrey, undertaken in virtue of a
special commission from the King, dated Sept. 23, 1633, to discover parts of America not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
“actually in the possession of any Christian Prince.”<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> These persons sailed from Falmouth,
Friday, May 16, 1634, and arriving between Capes Charles and Henry the 3d of
July, left Virginia on the 20th to explore the Delaware for a “Mediterranean Sea,”
said by the Indians “to be four days’ journey beyond the mountains,” from which they
hoped to find an outlet to the Pacific Ocean, affording a short passage to China and the
East Indies. On the 25th they entered Delaware Bay and proceeded leisurely up the
river (which Yong named “Charles,” in honor of his sovereign), conversing and trading
with the savages, as far as the present Trenton Falls, which they reached the 29th of
August, and where they were obliged to stop, on account of the rocks and the shallowness
of the water. On the 1st of September they were overtaken here by some “Hollanders
of Hudson’s River,” whom Yong entertained for a few days, but finally required to depart
under the escort of Evelin, who afterward explored the coast from Cape May to Manhattan,
and on his return made a second ineffectual attempt to pass beyond the rocks in
the Delaware.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> Both Yong and Evelin “resided several years” on this river, and undertook
to build a fort there at “Eriwomeck,” in the present State of New Jersey. Tidings
of their actions were frequently reported to Sir Edmund Plowden, and in 1641 was printed
a <i>Direction for Adventurers and Description of New Albion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> in a letter addressed to
Lady Plowden, written by Evelin. Books concerning the province were likewise published,
it is said,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> in 1637 and 1642.</p>

<p>About the close of 1641, the Earl Palatine at length visited America in person, and,
according to the testimony of Lord Baltimore,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> “in 1642 sailed up Delaware River,” one
of his men, named by Plantagenet “Master Miles,” either then or about that time
“swearing the officers” of an English settlement of seventy persons, at “Watcessit”
(doubtless the New Haven colonists at Varkens Kil, now Salem Creek, New Jersey<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>), to
“obedience” to him “as governor.” Plowden’s residence was chiefly in Virginia, where,
it is recorded, he bought a half-interest in a barque in 1643;<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and it is probable that he
had communication with Governor Leonard Calvert, of Maryland, since a maid-servant
belonging to him accompanied Margaret Brent, the intimate friend of the latter, on a visit
to the Isle of Kent, in Chesapeake Bay.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> The longest notice of him during his sojourn on
our continent occurs in a report of Johan Printz, Governor of New Sweden, to the Swedish
West India Company, dated at Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware), June 20, 1644,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> the
importance of which induces the writer to translate the whole of it. Says Printz,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In my former communications concerning the English knight, I have mentioned how last
year, in Virginia, he desired to sail with his people, sixteen in number, in a barque, from Heckemak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
to Kikathans;<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and when they came to the Bay of Virginia, the captain (who had previously
conspired with the knight’s people to kill him) directed his course not to Kikethan, but to Cape
Henry, passing which, they came to an isle in the high sea called Smith’s Island, when they
took counsel in what way they should put him to death, and thought it best not to slay him with
their hands, but to set him, without food, clothes, or arms, on the above-named island, which was
inhabited by no man or other animal save wolves and bears; and this they did. Nevertheless,
two young noble retainers, who had been brought up by the knight, and who knew nothing of that
plot, when they beheld this evil fortune of their lord, leaped from the barque into the ocean, swam
ashore, and remained with their master. The fourth day following, an English sloop sailed by
Smith’s Island, coming so close that the young men were able to hail her, when the knight was
taken aboard (half dead, and as black as the ground), and conveyed to Hackemak, where he recovered.
The knight’s people, however, arrived with the barque May 6, 1643, at our Fort Elfsborg,
and asked after ships to Old England. Hereupon I demanded their pass, and inquired from
whence they came; and as soon as I perceived that they were not on a proper errand, I took them
with me (though with their consent) to Christina, to bargain about flour and other provisions, and
questioned them until a maid-servant (who had been the knight’s washerwoman) confessed the
truth and betrayed them. I at once caused an inventory to be taken of their goods, in their presence,
and held the people prisoners, until the very English sloop which had rescued the knight
arrived with a letter from him concerning the matter, addressed not alone to me, but to all the
governors and commandants of the whole coast of Florida. Thereupon I surrendered to him the
people, barque, and goods (in precise accordance with the inventory), and he paid me 425 riksdaler
for my expenses. The chief of these traitors the knight has had executed. He himself is still in
Virginia, and (as he constantly professes) expects vessels and people from Ireland and England.
To all ships and barques that come from thence he grants free commission to trade here in the river
with the savages; but I have not yet permitted any of them to pass, nor shall I do so until I
receive order and command to that effect from my most gracious queen, her Royal Majesty of
Sweden.”</p>

<p class="p1">Printz’s opposition to Plowden’s encroachment within his territory was never relaxed,
and was entirely successful. In the course of his residence in America, the Earl Palatine
of New Albion visited New Amsterdam, “both in the time of Director Kieft and in that
of General Stuyvesant,” and, according to the <i>Vertoogh van Nieu Nederland</i>,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> “claimed
that the land on the west side of the North River to Virginia was his by gift of King
James [Charles] of England, but said he did not wish to have any strife with the Dutch,
though he was very much piqued at the Swedish governor, John Printz, at the South
River, on account of some affront given him, too long to relate; adding that when an
opportunity should offer, he would go there and take possession of the river.” Before
re-crossing the ocean, he went to Boston, his arrival being recorded in the Journal of Governor
John Winthrop, under date of June 4, 1648, having “been in Virginia about seven
years. He came first,” says the Governor, “with a patent of a County Palatine for Delaware
Bay, but wanting a pilot for that place, went to Virginia, and there having lost the
estate he brought over, and all his people scattered from him, he came hither to return to
England for supply, intending to return and plant Delaware, if he could get sufficient
strength to dispossess the Swedes.”</p>

<p>Immediately on reaching Europe, Plowden set about this task, and, to obtain the
greater credit for his title as “Earl Palatine of New Albion,” both in and out of that
province, as well as recognition of the legality and completeness of his charter, submitted
a copy of the latter to Edward Bysshe, “Garter Principal King of Arms of Englishmen,”
who received favorable written opinions on the subject from several serjeants and doctors
of laws, which, with the letters patent, were recorded by him Jan. 23, 1648/9, “in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
office of arms, there to remain in perpetual memory.”<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> At the same time (December,
1648) there was published another advertisement of Plowden’s enterprise, entitled <i>A
Description of the Province of New Albion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> by “Beauchamp Plantagenet, of Belvil, in
New Albion, Esquire,” purporting to contain “a full abstract and collection” of what had
already been written on the theme, with additional information acquired by the Earl Palatine
during his residence in America.</p>

<p>The work is dedicated “To the Right Honourable
and mighty Lord Edmund, by Divine Providence Lord Proprietor, Earl Palatine, Governour,
and Captain-Generall of the Province of New Albion, and to the Right Honourable
the Lord Vicount Monson of Castlemain, the Lord Sherard, Baron of Letrim, and to all
other the Vicounts, Barons, Baronets, Knights, Gentlemen, Merchants, Adventurers, and
Planters of the hopefull Company of New Albion, in all 44 undertakers and subscribers,
bound by Indenture
to bring and
settle 3,000 able
trained men in our
said severall Plantations
in the said
Province,”&mdash;the
author, himself
“one of the Company,”
professing
to “have had the
honour to be admitted
as” the
“familiar” of
Plowden, and to
“have marched,
lodged, and cabbined”
with him,
both “among the
Indians and in
Holland.”<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> It
opens with a short
treatise “of
Counts or Earls
created, and County
Palatines,” followed
by an adulatory
account of
the family of the
Proprietor, and a
defence of his title
to his province,
comprising some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
original statements with regard to the Dutch<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> and Swedes. Specific mention is made of
several tribes of Indians dwelling in New Albion, and of numerous “choice seats for
English,” some of which have been approximately identified.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> “For the Politique and
Civill Government, and Justice,” says the writer, “Virginia and New England is our
president: first, the Lord head Governour, a Deputy Governour, Secretary of Estate, or
Sealkeeper, and twelve of the Councell of State or upper House; and these, or five of
them, is also a Chancery Court. Next, out of Counties and Towns, at a free election
and day prefixed, thirty Burgesses, or Commons. Once yearly these meet, as at a Parliament
or Grand Assembly, and make Laws.... and without full consent of Lord, upper
and lower House, nothing is done.” “For Religion,” observes the author, “I conceive
the Holland way now practised best to content all parties: first, by Act of Parliament
or Grand Assembly, to settle and establish all the Fundamentals necessary to salvation....
But no persecution to any dissenting, and to all such, as to the Walloons, free Chapels;
and to punish all as seditious, and for contempt, as bitterly rail and condemn others
of the contrary: for this argument or perswasion of Religion, Ceremonies, or Church-Discipline,
should be acted in mildnesse, love, and charity, and gentle language, not to
disturb the peace or quiet of the Inhabitants, but therein to obey the Civill Magistrate,”&mdash;the
latter remarkable programme of universal tolerance in matters of faith being probably
designed to protect Catholic colonists in the same manner as the famous “Act concerning
Religion” passed by the Maryland Assembly the following year. The book
closes with some practical advice to “Adventurers,” and promises all such “of £500 to
bring fifty men shall have 5,000 acres, and a manor with Royalties, at 5<i>s.</i> rent; and
whosoever is willing so to transport himself or servant at £10 a man shall for each man
have 100 acres freely granted forever.”</p>

<p>The only evidence we possess that any result flowed from this fresh attempt to promote
emigration to New Albion is derived from documents in the Public Record Office at
London,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> stating that March 21, 1649-50, a “Petition of the Earl of New Albion relating
to the plantation there” was “referred to the consideration of the Committee of
Council;” that April 3, 1650, it was “referred to the Committee for Plantations, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
three of them, to confer with the Earl of Albion concerning the giving good security to
Council, that the men, arms, and ammunition, which he hath now shipped in order to his
voyage to New Albion, shall go thither, and shall not be employed either there or elsewhere
to the disservice of the public;” and that June 11, 1650, “a pass” was “granted
for Mr. Batt and Mr. Danby, themselves and seven score persons, men, women, and
children, to go to New Albion.” We have no other proof of the sailing of these people,
nor any knowledge of their arrival in America.</p>

<p>In 1651, there was offered for sale in London, <i>A mapp of Virginia</i>, compiled by
“Domina Virginia Farrer,”<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> designating the territory on the Delaware as “Nova Albion,”
as well as “Sweeds’ Plantation,” with a note: “This River the Lord Ployden hath a
Patten of, and calls it New Albion; but the Sweeds are planted in it, and have a great
trade of Furrs.” On the Jersey side of the stream are indicated the sites of “Richnek
Woods,” “Raritans,” “Mont Ployden,” “Eriwoms,” and “Axion,” and on the sea-coast
“Egg Bay,” all of which are mentioned in Plantagenet’s <i>New Albion</i>.</p>

<p>At that time Plowden was still in England,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> and we do not know that he ever returned
to his province. In his will, dated July 29, 1655, he styles himself “Sir Edmund Plowden,
of Wansted, in the County of Southton [Southampton], Knight, Lord, Earle Palatine, Governor
and Captain-Generall of the Province of New Albion in America,” and thinks “it fit
that” his “English lands and estates be settled and united to” his “Honour, County Palatine,
and Province of New Albion, for the maintenance of the same.” In consequence
of the “sinister and undue practises” of his eldest son, Francis Plowden, by whom, he
says, “he had been damnified and hindered these eighteene yeares,” “his mother, a mutable
woman, being by him perverted,” he bequeaths all his titles and property in England and
America, including his “Peerage of Ireland,” to his second son, Thomas Plowden, specially
mentioning “the province and County Palatine of New Albion,” whereof, he says,
“I am seized as of free principality, and held of the Crowne of Ireland, of which I am a
Peere, which Honor and title and province as Arundell, and many other Earledomes and
Baronies, is assignable and saleable with the province and County Palatine as a locall
Earledome.” He provides for the occupation and cultivation of New Albion as follows:
“I doe order and will that my sonne Thomas Plowden, and after his decease his eldest

<p>To each of eleven
parishes in England, where he owned land, he left forty pounds; and directs that he be
buried in the chapel of the Plowdens at Ledbury, in Salop, under a stone monument, with
“brasse plates” of his “eighteene children had affixed at thirty or fourty powndes charges,
together with” his “perfect pedigree as is drawne at” his “house.” He “died,” says
“Albion,” “at Wanstead, county of Southampton, in 1659,” his will being admitted to
probate in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, July 27 of that year.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Thomas Plowden
survived his father forty years, but what benefit he derived from the inheritance of
New Albion does not appear. His own will is dated May 16, 1698, and was admitted to
probate in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury the 10th of the following September. In
it he describes himself as “Thomas Plowden, of Lasham, in the county of Southton,
Gent;” and after leaving all his children and grandchildren “ten shillings a piece of lawfull
English money,” proceeds: “I do give and bequeath unto my son Francis Plowden
the Letters Pattent and Title, with all advantages and profitts thereunto belonging, And
as it was granted by our late Sovereign Lord King Charles the first over England, under
the great Seal of England, unto my ffather, Sir Edmund Plowden, of Wansted, in the
County of Southton, now deceased, The province and County palatine of New Albion, in
America, or in North Virginia and America, which pattent is now in the custody of my
son-in-law, Andrew Wall, of Ludshott, in the said County of Southton, who has these
severall years wrongfully detained it, to my great Loss and hinderance. And all the
rest and residue of my goods, chattles, and personall Estate, after my debts and Legacies
be paid and funerall discharged, I give and devise unto my wife, Thomazine Plowden, of
Lasham.”<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>That Plowden’s claim to the territory of New Albion was not forgotten in America,
appears from the following allusions to it. In a conversation recorded by the Swedish
engineer, Peter Lindström,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> as occurring in New Sweden, June 18, 1654, between the
Swedes and “Lawrence Lloyd, the English Commandant of Virginia,” concerning the
rights of their respective nations to jurisdiction over the Delaware, the latter laid particular
stress upon the fact that “Sir Edward Ployde and Earl of Great Albion had a
special grant of that river from King James.” On the other hand, on occasion of the
embassy of Augustine Herman and Resolved Waldron on behalf of the Director-General
of New Netherland to the Governor of Maryland, in October, 1659, Plowden’s title was
spoken of by them as “subretively and fraudulently obtained” and “invalid;” while
Secretary Philip Calvert affirmed that “Ployten had had no commission, and lay in jail in
England on account of his debts, relating that he had solicited a patent for <i>Novum
Albium</i> from the King, but it was refused him, and he thereupon applied to the Viceroy
of Ireland, from whom he had obtained a patent, but that it was of no value,”<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>&mdash;allegations,
it is understood, of interested parties, which therefore possess less weight as testimony
against the rights of Plowden. At the same time the title of the Earl Palatine to
his American province was recognized in the last edition of Peter Heylin’s <i>Cosmographie</i>,
which was revised by the author, and published in London in 1669,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> and in Philips’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
enlarged edition of John Speed’s <i>Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain</i> and <i>Prospect
of the Most Famous Parts of the World</i>, printed in London in 1676.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>From this period the history of New Albion is more obscure. There is proof, however,
of the residence in Maryland, in May, 1684, of certain Thomas and George Plowden,
affirmed, on grounds of family tradition, by persons who claim to be descended from one of
them, to be sons of a son of the original patentee, who had brought his wife and children
to America to take possession of his estates, but had been murdered by the Indians.
That the ancestral jurisdiction over the province was never entirely lost sight of, is shown
by the circumstance that the title peculiar to it was constantly retained by later generations
of this race.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> Just before the American Revolution, Charles Varlo, Esq., of England,
purchased the third part of the Charter of New Albion, and in 1784 visited this
country with his family, “invested with proper power as Governor to the Province, ... not
doubting,” as he says, “the enjoyment of his property.” He made an extended
tour through Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, and distributed
among the inhabitants a pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> comprising a translation in English of the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
charter enrolled at Dublin, copies of the lease to Danby, and the release of Ryebread and
others, before referred to, an address of the “Earl Palatine of Albion” to the public, and
conditions for letting or selling land in New Albion. He likewise issued “a proclamation,
in form of a handbill, addressed to the people of New Albion, in the name of the Earl of
Albion,”<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> and published in the papers of the day (July, 1785) “A Caution to the Good
People of the Province of New Albion, <i>alias</i> corruptly called, at present, The Jerseys,”
not to buy or contract with any person for any land in said province.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> He formed the
acquaintance of Edmund (called by him Edward) Plowden, representative of St. Mary’s
County in the Legislature of Maryland, a member of the family already mentioned, and
endeavored to interest that gentleman in his schemes. Finding his land settled under the
grant to the Duke of York, he also sought counsel of William Rawle, a distinguished
lawyer of Philadelphia, and “took every step possible,” he affirms, “to recover the estate
by law in chancery, but in vain, because judge and jury were landowners therein, consequently
parties concerned. Therefore, after much trouble and expense,” he “returned
to Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Varlo’s last act was to indite two letters to the Prince of Wales, reciting
his grievances and appealing for redress, but conceived in such a tone as would seem to
have precluded a response.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> Thus ended this curious episode in the history of English
colonization in America.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE FOUNDING OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY FREDERICK D. STONE,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Librarian of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE founding of Pennsylvania was one of the immediate results of
Penn’s connection with West Jersey; but the causes which led to
the settlement of both colonies can be clearly traced to the rise of the
religious denomination of which he was a distinguished member. This
occurred in one of the most exciting periods of English history. The
Long Parliament was in session. Events were directly leading to the
execution of the King. All vestiges of the Church of Rome had been
well-nigh swept away in a country in which that Church had once held
undisputed sway, and its successor was faring but little better with the
armies of the Commonwealth. The conflict between Presbyterians and
Churchmen,&mdash;in the efforts of the former to change the Established
Church, and of the latter to maintain their position,&mdash;was scarcely more
bitter in spirit than the temper with which the Independents denounced
all connection between Church and State. Other dissenting congregations
at the same time availed themselves of a season of unprecedented
religious liberty to express their views, and religious discussions became
the daily talk of the people.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that the ministry of George Fox
began. Born in the year 1624, a native of Leicestershire, he was from
his youth noted for “a gravity and stayedness of mind and spirit not
usual in children.” As he approached manhood, he became troubled
about the condition of his soul, and passed through an experience similar
to that which tried his contemporary, John Bunyan, when he imagined
that he had sinned against the Holy Ghost. His friends had advised him
to marry or to join the army; but his immediate recourse was rather to
spiritual counsel. He naturally sought this from the clergymen of the
Established Church, in which he had been bred; but they failed to satisfy
his mind.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250">GEORGE FOX.</p>
         <p class="pf250">[This follows Holmes’s engraving of the
portrait of Fox, by Honthorst, in 1654, when
Fox was in his thirtieth year. This Dutch painter,
if Gerard Honthorst, was born in Utrecht
in 1592, was at one time in England, and died
in 1660; if his brother William, he died in 1683,
aged 73. The original canvas was recently offered
for sale in England. A view of Swarthmore Hall, where Fox
lived, is in Gay’s <i>Popular
History of the United States</i>, ii. 173.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>The first whom he consulted repeated to his servants what
George had said, until the young man was distressed to find that his
troubles were the subjects of jests with the milk-maids. Another told him
to sing psalms and smoke a pipe. A third flew into a violent passion
because, as the talk
turned upon the birth
of Christ, Fox inadvertently
placed his foot
upon the flower-bed.
A fourth bled and physicked
him. Such consolations,
presented
while he was earnestly
seeking to comprehend
the greatest question of
life, disgusted him. He
then turned for comfort
to the Dissenters; but
they, as he tells us, were
unable to fathom his
condition. From this
time he avoided professors
and teachers of
all kinds. He read the
Scriptures diligently,
and strove, by the use
of the faculties which
God had given him, to
understand their true
meaning. He was not
a man of learning, and was obliged to settle all questions as they arose by
such reasonings as he could bring to bear upon them. The anguish which
he experienced was terrible, and at times he was tempted to despair; but
his strong mind held him to the truth, and his wonderfully clear perception
of right and wrong led him step by step towards the goal of his desires.
By degrees the ideas which had been taught him in childhood were put
aside. It became evident to him that it was not necessary for a man to be
bred at Oxford or Cambridge to become a minister of Christ; and he felt
as never before the meaning of the words, “God dwelleth not in temples
made with hands.” To one of his understanding such convictions seemed
as revelations from Heaven. That all men are capable of receiving the
same Light to guide them, and that all who would follow this Light would
be guided to the same end, became his belief; and to preach this faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
constituted his mission. He also felt that they who were guided by this
Inner Light should be known by the simplicity of their speech and manners;
that as the temples of the Lord were the hearts of his people, the
ceremonies of the prevailing modes of worship were empty forms; that
tithes for the support of a ministry, and taxes for the promotion of war
and like measures, should not be paid by persons who could not approve of
the purposes for which they were collected; and that the taking of an
oath, even to add weight to testimony, was contrary to the teachings of
the Scriptures.</p>

<p>These, in brief, were the views of the people called Quakers. That a
movement so purely spiritual in its aims should have exercised a political
influence seems remarkable. But the principles upon which the movement
was founded claimed for the mind a perfect freedom; they counted as
nought the privileges of rank, and demanded an entire separation of
Church and State.</p>

<p>The first followers of George Fox were from the neighborhood of his
own home; but his views soon spread among the yeomanry of the adjoining
counties. His theology may have been crude, his grammar faulty, and
his appearance ludicrous; yet there was a personal magnetism about the
man which drew to him disciples from all classes.</p>

<p>Nothing could check the energy with which he labored, or silence the
voice which is yet spoken of as that of a prophet. In his enthusiasm the
people seemed to him like “fallow ground,” and the priests but “lumps
of clay,” unable to furnish the seed for a harvest. Jeered at and beaten by
cruel mobs, reviled as a fanatic and denounced as an impostor, he travelled
from place to place, sometimes to be driven forth to sleep under
haystacks, and at other times to be imprisoned as a disturber of the
peace. But through all trials his faith remained unshaken, and he denounced
what he believed to be the falsehoods of the times, until, as he
says, the priests fled when they heard that “the man in leathern breeches
is come.”</p>

<p>In 1654, but ten years after George Fox had begun to preach, his followers
were to be found in most parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland.
Notwithstanding the persecutions with which an avowal of Quakerism was
met, they adhered to their convictions with a steadfastness equal to that of
their leader. Imprisonment, starvation, and the lash, as the penalties of
their religion, had no fears for them. Their estates were wasted for tithes
and taxes which they felt it wrong to pay. Their meetings were dispersed
by armed men, and all laws that could be so construed were interpreted
against them. All such persecution, however, was of no avail. “They
were a people who could not be won with either gifts, honors, offices, or
place.” Nor is it surprising that their desire to share equally such sufferings
in the cause of truth should have touched the heart of one educated
in the severe school of the Commonwealth. When Fox lay in Lanceston
jail, one of his people called upon Cromwell and asked to be imprisoned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
his stead. “Which of you,” said Cromwell, turning to his Council, “would
do so much for me if I were in the same condition?”</p>

<p>Satisfied in their hearts with the strength which their faith gave them,
the Quakers could not rest until they had carried the glad tidings to others.
In 1655, Fox tells us, “many went beyond the sea, where truth also sprung
up, and in 1656 it broke forth in America and many other places.”</p>

<p>It has ever been one of the cardinal principles of the followers of Fox
to obey the laws under which they live, when doing so does not interfere
with their consciences. When this last is the case, their convictions
impel them to treat the oppressive measures as nullities, not even so far
recognizing the existence of such statutes as to cover their violation of them
with a shadow of secrecy. It was against what Fox considered ecclesiastical
tyranny that the weight of his ministry was directed. Those who lived
under church government he believed to be in as utter spiritual darkness as
it is the custom of Christendom to regard the other three-fourths of mankind;
and it was with a feeling akin to that which will to-day prompt
a missionary to carry the Bible to the wildest tribes of Africa, that the
Quakers of 1656 came to the Puritan commonwealths of America.</p>

<p>The record of the first landing of the Quakers in this country belongs to
another chapter,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> and the historians of New England must tell the sad story,
which began in 1656, of the intrusive daring for conviction’s sake which
characterized the conduct of these humble preachers. In June, 1657, six
of a party of eight Quakers who had been sent back to England the
year previous, re-embarked for America. They were accompanied by five
others, and on October 1 five of them landed at New Amsterdam. The rest
remained on the vessel, and on the 3d instant arrived at Rhode Island. It
was chiefly through the labors of this little band that the doctrines of the
Quakers were spread through the British colonies of North America.</p>

<p>It was in 1661 that the first Yearly Meeting of Friends in America was
established in Rhode Island, and in 1672 the government of the colony
was in their hands. The Dutch of New Amsterdam did not hold as broad
views of religious liberty as were entertained by their kinsfolk in Holland;
but while the Quakers were severely dealt with in that city, on Long Island
they were allowed to live in comparative peace. In Maryland the treatment
of the Friends, severe at times, grew more and more tolerant, and
when Fox visited them in 1672 he found many to welcome him; and probably
the first letter from a Meeting in England to one in America was
directed to that of Maryland. In Virginia the Episcopalians were less
liberal than their neighbors in other provinces. The intolerance with which
Dissenters were met drove many beyond her borders, and thus it was that
some Friends gathered in the Carolinas.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Fifth Monarchy men in 1660, immediately after the
restoration of Charles II., dispelled any hopes which the Quakers might
have gathered from that monarch’s proclamation at Breda, since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
were suspected of being connected with that party. It is at this time that
we find the first evidence that Fox and his followers wished to obtain
a spot in America which they could call their own; and the desire was
obviously the result of the troubles which they encountered, both in England
and America. Before this was accomplished, however, the Quakers
experienced many trials. In 1661 Parliament passed an Act for their
punishment, denouncing them as a mischievous and dangerous people.</p>

<p>In 1672 Charles II. issued his second declaration regarding liberty of
conscience, and comparative quiet was for a few years enjoyed by his Dissenting
subjects. In 1673 Parliament censured the declaration of the King
as an undue use of the prerogative. The sufferings of the Quakers were
then renewed. It is unnecessary to repeat in detail the penalties inflicted
under the various Acts of Parliament. Fox was repeatedly imprisoned,
and many of his followers died in confinement from ill usage. In 1675
West Jersey was offered for sale. The advantages its possession would
afford were at once appreciated by the men of broad views who had obtained
control of the Quaker affairs. Fox favored the scheme. Some of
his followers felt that to emigrate was to fly from persecution and to desert
a cause; but Fox, with more wisdom, had as early as 1660 proposed
the purchase of a tract of land in America. Between 1656 and 1675 he
and his devoted followers were from time to time braving all kinds of
danger in the propagation of their faith throughout the English colonies
in America. Their wanderings often brought them into contact with the
Indians, and this almost always led to the friendliest of relations.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>William Penn possessed more influence with the ruling class of England
than did any other of the followers of Fox. His joining the Friends in
1668 is a memorable event in the history of their Society. The son of
Admiral Sir William Penn, the conqueror of Jamaica, and of his wife Margaret,
daughter of John Jasper, of Amsterdam, he was born in London
Oct. 14, 1644, the year in which Fox began to preach to his neighbors in
Leicestershire. The Admiral was active in bringing about the restoration
of the Stuarts, and this, together with his naval services, gave him an influence
at Court which would have enabled him to advance the interests of his
son.</p>

The above cut represents him at twenty-two. It
follows a large private steel plate, engraved by
S. A. Schoff, of Boston, with the aid of a crayon
reduction by William Hunt, and represents an
original likeness painted in oils in 1666 by an
unknown artist, possibly Sir Peter Lely. It was
one of two preserved at Stoke Poges for a long
time, and this one was given in 1833 by Penn’s
grandson, Granville Penn, to the Historical Society
of Pennsylvania. (<i>Catalogue of Paintings,
etc., belonging to the Historical Society</i>, 1872, no. 50.)
There are other engravings of it in the <i>Pennsylvania
Magazine of History</i>, i. 361; in Janney’s <i>Life

Watson’s <i>Annals of Philadelphia</i>. A portrait by
Francis Place, representing Penn at fifty-two, is
engraved from the National Museum copy of the
original in Gay’s <i>Popular History of the United

1874, and its story is told in Mr. Etting’s paper.
There is another engraving of it in Egle’s <i>Pennsylvania</i>.
Maria Webb’s <i>Penns and Peningtons</i>
(1867) gives an account of a recently discovered
crayon likeness. (Cf. <i>Catalogue of Paintings, etc.,

steel engraving was issued in Germany some
years since, purporting to be from a portrait by
Kneller,&mdash;which is quite possible,&mdash;and this
engraving is reproduced a little larger than the
German one in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, October,
1882. The likeness best known is probably the
one introduced by West in his well-known picture
of the making of the Treaty. In this, West,
who never saw Penn, seemingly followed one of
the medallions or busts made by Sylvanus Bevan,
a contemporary of Penn, who had a natural skill
in cutting likenesses in ivory. One of these medallions
is given in Smith and Watson’s <i>American
Historical and Literary Curiosities</i>, i. pl. xv., and in
the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, October, 1882. Bevan’s
bust was also the original of the head of the
statue, with a broad-brim hat, which has stood in
the grounds of the Pennsylvania Hospital since
John Penn, son of the Proprietary, bought it
from the estate of Lord Le Despenser at High
Wycombe, and gave it to the hospital. The
same head was again used as the model of the
wooden bust which was in the Loganian Library,
but was destroyed by fire in 1831. Proud’s <i>History
of Pennsylvania</i> (1797) gives an engraving of
it; and the likeness in Clarkson’s <i>Life of Penn</i> is
also credited to one of Bevan’s busts. Inman’s

<p>But while a student at Oxford, the young Penn chanced to hear the
preaching of Thomas Loe, a Quaker, and so impressed was he by it that he
ceased to attend the religious services of his College. For this he was expelled
from the University. His father, after a brief impulse of anger which
this disgrace caused, sent him to Paris, and in that gay capital the impressions
made by the Quaker preacher were nearly effaced. From Paris he
went to Saumur and
became a pupil of
Moses Amyrault, a
learned professor of
the French Reformed
Church. At the conclusion
of his studies
he travelled in France
and Italy, and in 1664
returned to England,&mdash;a
fashionable gentleman,
with an “affected
manner of
speech and gait.”
The dreadful scenes
which occurred the
next year in London
during the Plague
again turned his
thoughts from worldly
affairs. To overcome
this seriousness
his father sent him to
Ireland. While there,
an insurrection broke
out among the soldiers
at Carrickfergus
Castle, and he served
as a volunteer under
Lord Arran in its suppression.
The Viceroy
of Ireland was willing to reward this service by giving him a military
command, but Admiral Penn refused his consent. It was at this time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
the accompanying portrait was painted. While in Ireland, Penn again came
under the influence of the preaching of Loe, and in his heart became a
Quaker. He was shortly afterwards arrested with others at a Quaker meeting.
His conduct alienated his father from him, but a reconciliation followed
when the Admiral learned how sincere the young Quaker was in his views.</p>

<p>Penn wrote industriously in the cause, and endeavored by personal solicitation
at Court to obtain for the Quakers more liberal treatment. Imprisoned
in the Tower for heresy, he passed his time in writing <i>No Cross,
No Crown</i>. Released through his father’s influence with the Duke of
York, he was soon again arrested under the Conventicle Act for having
spoken at a Quaker meeting, and his trial for this offence is a celebrated
one in the annals of English law.</p>

<p>In September, 1670, his father died, leaving him an ample fortune, besides
large claims on the Government. But the temptations of wealth had
no influence on Penn. He continued to defend the faith he had embraced,
and in the latter part of the year was again in Newgate. There he wrote
<i>The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience debated</i>. Had his services to
humanity been no greater than those rendered by the pen, they would have
secured for him a lasting remembrance; but the experience he gained in
defending the principles of the Friends was fitting him for higher responsibilities.
His mind, which was naturally bright, had been improved by
study. In such rough schools of statesmanship as the Old Bailey, Newgate,
and the Tower, he imbibed broad and liberal views of what was necessary
for the welfare of mankind, which in the end prompted him to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
a practical interpretation of the philosophy of More and Harrington. His
interest in West Jersey<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> led him to make extensive investments in the enterprise;
but notwithstanding the zeal and energy with which it was pushed, the
result was far from satisfactory. The disputes between Fenwick and the
creditors of Byllynge, and the transfer by the former of a large portion of
his interest to Eldridge and Warner in security for a debt, left a cloud upon
the title of land purchased there, and naturally deterred people from emigrating.
False reports detrimental to the colony were also circulated in
England, while the claim of Byllynge, that his parting with an interest in
the soil did not affect his right to govern, and the continued assumption of
authority by Andros over East Jersey and the ports on the Delaware, added
to the feeling of dissatisfaction. This is clearly shown in a pamphlet published
in 1681, the preface of which says it was put forth “to contradict the
Disingenuous and False Reports of some men who have made it their business
to speak unjustly of New Jersey and our Proceedings therein: As
though the Methods of Settlement were confused and Uncertain, no man
Knowing his own Land, and several such idle Lying Stories.”<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>It was in this condition of affairs that Penn conceived the idea of obtaining
a grant of land in America in settlement of a debt of £16,000 due the
estate of his father from the Crown. We have no evidence showing when
this thought first took form in his mind, but his words and actions prove
that it was not prompted in order to better his worldly condition. Certain
it is that the eyes of the Friends had long been turned to what is now Pennsylvania
as a spot upon which they might find a refuge from persecution.
In 1660, when George Fox first thought of a Quaker settlement in America,
he wrote on this subject to Josiah Coale, who was then with the Susquehanna
Indians north of Maryland. The reply from Maryland is dated
“eleventh month, 1660,” and reads,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,&mdash;As concerning Friends buying a piece of Land of the Susquehanna
Indians, I have spoken of it to them, and told them what thou said concerning
it; but their answer was that there is no land that is habitable or fit for situation beyond
Baltimore’s liberty till they come to or near the Susquehanna’s fort.”</p>

<p class="p1">In 1681 Penn, in writing about his province, said: “This I can say, that I
had an opening of joy as to these parts in the year 1661 at Oxford twenty
years since.” The interest which centred in West Jersey caused the
scheme to slumber, until revived by Penn in 1680.</p>

<p>The petition to the King was presented about the 1st of June, 1680.
It asked for a tract of land “lying North of Maryland, on the East bounded
with Delaware River, on the West limited as Maryland is, and Northward to
extend as far as plantable, which is altogether Indian.” This, “his Maj<sup>ty</sup>
being graciously disposed to gratify,” was referred to the Lords of Trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
and Plantations, and if it should meet with their approval, they were to consider
“such restrictions, limitations, and other Clauses as were fitting to be
inserted in the Grant.”</p>

<p>The proceedings which followed prevented the issue of the charter for
some time. “A caution was used,” says Chalmers, “in proportion to the
inattention with which former patents had been given, almost to every
petitioner. Twenty years had now taught circumspection, and the recent
refractoriness of Massachusetts had impressed the ministers with a proper
sense of danger, at least of inconvenience.” The agents of the Duke of
York and of Lord Baltimore were consulted about the proposed boundaries,
and the opinions of Chief-Justice North and the Attorney-General were
taken on the same subjects, as well as on the powers that were to be conferred.
The charter as granted gave to Penn and his successors all the
territory between the fortieth and forty-second degrees of latitude, extending
through five degrees of longitude west from the Delaware River, with
the exception of that part which would fall within a circle drawn twelve
miles around New Castle, the northern segment of which was to form the
boundary between Penn’s province and the Duke of York’s colonies of
Delaware. It was supposed that such a circle would be intersected on the
west by the fortieth degree of latitude, the proposed boundary between
Pennsylvania and Maryland. This erroneous opinion was the cause of a prolonged
litigation. The allegiance of the Proprietary and of the inhabitants
was reserved to the Crown. The right to govern was vested in Penn. He
could appoint officers, and with the consent of the people make such laws
as were necessary; but to insure their unison with those of England they
were to be submitted to the Crown within five years for approval. He
could raise troops for the defence of his province, and collect taxes and
duties; but the latter were to be in addition to those ordered by Parliament.
He could pardon all crimes except treason and wilful murder, and grant reprieves
in such cases until the pleasure of the King should be known. The
Bishop of London had the power to appoint a chaplain on the petition of
twenty of the inhabitants, and an agent was to reside near the Court to
explain any misdemeanor that might be committed.</p>

<p>The charter was signed March 4, 1681, and on the next day Penn wrote
to Robert Turner,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“After many waitings, watchings, solicitings, and disputes in Council, this day my
country was confirmed to me under the Great Seal of England, with large powers and
privileges, by the name of Pennsilvania, a name the King would have given in honor
of my father. I chose New Wales, being as this a pretty hilly country, ... for I
feared lest it should be looked as a vanity in me and not as a respect in the King, as
it truly was, to my father, whom he often mentions with praise. Thou mayst communicate
my graunt to friends, and expect shortly my proposals; ‘tis a clear and just
thing; and my God, that has given it me through many difficulties, will, I believe,
bless and make it the seed of a nation. I shall have a tender care to the government,
that it will be well laid at first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On the 2d of April a royal proclamation, addressed to those who were
already settled within the province, informed them of the granting of the
patent, and its character. Six days afterwards Penn prepared a letter to
be read to the settlers by his representative, couched in language of friendship
and affection. He told them frankly that government was a business
he had never undertaken, but that it was his wish to do it uprightly. You
are “at the mercy of no governor,” he said, “who comes to make his fortune
great; you shall be governed by laws of your own making, and live a
free and, if you will, a sober and industrious people.” On the same day he
gave to his kinsman, William Markham, whom he had selected to be his
deputy-governor, and who was to precede him to Pennsylvania, instructions
regarding the first business to be transacted. Two days afterwards he furnished
him with his commission and more explicit directions, and Markham
shortly afterwards sailed for America, and probably landed in Boston, where
his commission is recorded. By the 15th of June he had reached New
York, and Brockholls on the 21st issued an order addressed to the civil
officers within the limits of Pennsylvania, yielding to Markham his authority
as the representative of the Duke of York. Markham carried letters from
the King and from Penn to Lord Baltimore. The former recommended “the
infant colony and its leader to his friendly aid.” He also required the patentee
of Maryland “to make a true division of the two provinces according
to the boundaries and degrees expressed in their patents.” The letter of
Penn authorized Markham to settle the boundaries. Markham met Lord
Baltimore in August, 1681, and while at his house was taken so ill that
nothing was decided upon.</p>

<p>Soon after the confirmation of his charter, Penn issued a pamphlet, in
which the essential parts of that instrument were given, together with an
account of the country and the views he entertained for its government.
The conditions on which he proposed to dispose of land were, a share of
five thousand acres free from any Indian incumbrance for £100, and one
shilling English quit-rent for one hundred acres, the quit-rent not to begin
until after 1684. Those who hired were to pay one penny per acre for lots
not exceeding two hundred acres. Fifty acres per head were allowed to
the masters of servants, and the same quantity was given to every servant
when his time should expire. A plan for building cities was also suggested,
in which all should receive lots in proportion to their investments.</p>

<p>The unselfishness and purity of Penn’s motives, and the religious feelings
with which he was inspired, are evident from his letters. On the 12th of
April, 1681, he wrote to three of his friends,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Having published a paper with relation to my province in America (at least what
I thought advisable to publish), I here inclose one that you may know and inform
others of it. I have been these thirteen years the servant of truth and Friends, and
for my testimony sake lost much, not only the greatness and preferments of this world,
but £16,000 of my estate, that had I not been what I am I had long ago obtained.
But I murmur not; the Lord is good to me, and the interest his truth has given me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
with his people may more than repair it; for many are drawn forth to be concerned
with me: and perhaps this way of satisfaction has more the hand of God in it than a
downright payment.... For the matter of liberty and privilege, I propose that which
is extraordinary, and to leave myself and successors no power of doing mischief,&mdash;that
the will of one man may not hinder the good of an whole country. But to publish
those things now and here, as matters stand, would not be wise, and I was advised
to reserve that until I came there.”</p>

<p class="p1">To another he wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“And because I have been somewhat exercised at times about the nature and end
of government among men, it is reasonable to expect that I should endeavor to
establish a just and righteous one in this province, that others may take example by
it,&mdash;truly this my heart desires. For the nations want a precedent.... I do, therefore,
desire the Lord’s wisdom to guide me, and those that may be concerned with
me, that we may do the thing that is truly wise and just.”</p>

<p class="p1">And again,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“For my country, I eyed the Lord in obtaining it, and more was I drawn inward
to look to him, and to owe it to his hand and power than to any other way. I have
so obtained it, and desire to keep it that I may not be unworthy of his love, but do
that which may answer his kind Providence and serve his truth and people, that an
example may be set up to the nations. There may be room there, though not here,
for such an holy experiment.”</p>

<p class="p1">The scheme grew apace, and, as Penn says, “many were drawn forth to
be concerned with him.” His prominence as a Quaker attracted the attention
of Quakers in all quarters. He had travelled in their service in Wales,
and from thence some of the first settlers came. Two visits to Holland and
Germany had made him known to the Mennonites and like religious bodies
there. His pamphlet was reprinted at Amsterdam, and the seed sown soon
brought forth abundantly. By July 11, 1681, matters had so far progressed
that it was necessary to form a definite agreement between Penn and the
purchasers, and a paper known as “Certain Conditions or Concessions” was
executed.</p>

<p>By this time also (July, 1681) troubles with Lord Baltimore were anticipated
in England, and some of the adventurers were deterred from purchasing.
Penn at once began negotiations for the acquirement of the Duke
of York’s interests on the Delaware. Meanwhile, in the face of all these
rumors, Penn refused to part with any of his rights, except on the terms
and in the spirit which he had announced. Six thousand pounds were
offered for a monopoly of the Indian trade, but he declined it; “I would
not,” are his words, “so defile what came to me clean.”</p>

<p>William Crispin, John Bezar, and Nathaniel Allen were commissioned
by Penn (Sept. 30, 1681) to assist Markham. They were to select a site
for a town, and superintend its laying out. William Haige was subsequently
added to the number. By them he sent to the Indians a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
of an affectionate character, and another to be read to the Swedes by
their ministers.</p>

<p>The first commissioners probably sailed on the “John Sarah,” which
cleared for Pennsylvania in October. She is supposed to have been the
first vessel to arrive there after Penn received his grant.</p>

<p>On August 24, 1682, Penn acquired from the Duke of York the town
of New Castle and the country twelve miles around it, and the same day
the Duke conveyed to him the territory lying south of New Castle, reserving
for himself one half the rents. The first of these gifts professed to have
been made on account of the Duke’s respect for the memory of Sir William
Penn. A deed was also obtained from the Duke (August 20) for any right
he might have to Pennsylvania as a part of New Netherland.</p>

<p>Having completed his business in England, Penn prepared to sail for
America. On the 4th of August, from his home at Worminghurst, he
addressed to his wife and children a letter of singular beauty, manliness,
and affection. It is evident from it that he appreciated the dangers before
him, as well as the responsibilities which he had assumed. To his wife,
who was the daughter of Sir William Springett, he wrote: “Remember thy
mother’s example when thy father’s public-spiritedness had worsted his
estate, which is my case.” To his children, fearing he would see them no
more, he said: “And as for you who are likely to be concerned in the government
of Pennsylvania and my parts of East Jersey, especially the first,
I do charge you before the Lord God and His holy angels, that you be
lowly, diligent, and tender, fearing God, loving the people, and hating
covetousness.” To both, in closing, he wrote: “So farewell to my thrice-dearly
beloved wife and children. Yours as God pleaseth, in that which
no waters can quench, no time forget, nor distance wear away.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of August he wrote to all faithful friends in England, and
the next day there “sailed out of the Downs three ships bound for Pennsylvania,
on board of which was Mr. Pen, with a great many Quakers who
go to settle there.” Such was the announcement in the <i>London Gazette</i> of
September 4, of the departure of those who were to found one of the most
prosperous of the British colonies in America.</p>

<p>With the exception of a narrow strip of land along the Delaware, on
which were scattered a few Swedish hamlets, the tract covered by the royal
grant to Penn was a wilderness. It contained, exclusive of Indians, about
five hundred souls. The settlements extended from the southern limits of
the province for a few miles above the mouth of the Schuylkill, and then
there was nothing until Crewcorne was reached, opposite the Falls of Delaware.
None of these settlements rose to the dignity of a village, unless it
was Upland, at which place the Court was held. The territory acquired
from the Duke of York contained about the same number of persons as
did Pennsylvania. Many, however, who lived in either section were Swedes
or Finns. A few Dutch had settled among them, and some Quaker families
had crossed from New Jersey and taken up land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Penn found the Swedes “a strong, industrious people,” who knew little
beside the rudiments of agriculture, and cared not to cultivate beyond their
needs.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> The fertile country in which they dwelt yielded adequate supply
with moderate labor, and to the English settlers it appeared to be a paradise.
The reports which Penn’s people sent home encouraged others to come,
and although their accounts were highly colored, none of the new-comers
seem to have been disappointed. The first descriptions we have of the
country after it became Pennsylvania are in the letters of Markham. To
his wife he wrote, Dec. 7, 1681,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is a very fine Country, if it were not so overgrown with Woods, and very
Healthy. Here people live to be above one hundred years of Age. Provisions of all
sorts are indifferent plentiful, <i>Venison</i> especially; I have seen four <i>Bucks</i> bought for
less than 5<i>s.</i> The Indians kill them only for their Skins, and if the Christians will not
buy the Flesh they let it hang and rot on a Tree. In the Winter there is mighty
plenty of Wild Fowl of all sorts. Partridges I am cloyed with; we catch them by
hundreds at a time. In the fall of the leaf, or after Harvest, here are abundance of
wild Turkeys, which are mighty easie to be Shot; Duck, Mallard, Geese, and Swans
in abundance, wild; Fish are in great plenty. In short, if a Country Life be liked by
any, it might be here.”</p>

<p class="p1">Markham, after his arrival, had taken such steps as were necessary to
establish the authority of Penn. On the 3d of August nine of the residents,
selected by him, took the oath to act as his council. A court was
held at Upland September 13, the last court held there under the authority
of the Duke of York having adjourned until that time. By Penn’s instructions,
all was to be done “according to the good laws of England. But the
new court during the first year of its existence failed to comply with these
laws in a very essential particular,&mdash;persons were put upon trial without
the intervention of a grand jury. No provision was made under the Duke’s
laws for the safeguard of the citizen, and the new justices acted for a time
in accordance with former usage. A petit jury, so rare under the former
court, now participated in every trial where facts were in dispute. In
criminal cases the old practice was adhered to, of making the prosecutor
plaintiff.”<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>During 1681 at least two vessels arrived with settlers. Of the commissioners
who were sent out in October to assist Markham, Crispin died
at Barbadoes. April 23, 1682, Thomas Holme, bearing a commission of
surveyor-general, sailed from England, and arrived about June. Already
the site for Philadelphia had been selected, as James Claypoole, who was
in England, wrote, July 14, that he “had one hundred acres where our
capital city is to be, upon the river near Schuylkill.” July 15, 1682,
Markham purchased from the Indians a tract of land on the Delaware
below the Falls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Welsh emigrants arrived on the 13th of August, 1682. They
were Quakers from Merionethshire who had felt the hand of persecution.
They had bought from Penn in England five thousand acres of unsurveyed
land, and had been promised by him the reservation of a large tract exclusively
for Welsh settlers, to the end that they might preserve the customs
of their native land, decide all debates “in a Gospel order,” and not entangle
themselves “with laws in an unknown tongue.” At Philadelphia they found
a crowd of people endeavoring to have their farms surveyed, for although
the site of the city was chosen, the town lots were not laid out. In a few
days the Welshmen had the first part surveyed of what became known as
the Welsh Barony. It lay on the west side of the Schuylkill, north of
Philadelphia. The warrant for surveying the entire tract, which contained
forty thousand acres, was not issued until 1684. Special privileges appear
to have been accorded to these settlers. Township officers were not chosen
for their districts until 1690, and their Friends’ Meetings exercised authority
in civil affairs. From these facts it is possible that the intention was to protect
the Welsh in the rights of local self-government by erecting the tract
into a manor. By a clause in the royal charter, Penn could erect “manors,
to have and to hold a court baron, with all things whatsoever to a court
baron do belong.” To a company known as the “Free Society of Traders”
he had (March 20, 1682) granted these extraordinary privileges, empowering
them to hold courts of sessions and jail deliveries, to constitute a
court-leet, and to appoint certain civil officers for their territory. This was
known as the Manor of Frank. To Nicholas More, the president of the
Company, the Manor of Moreland was granted, with like privileges; but
neither More nor the Company seem to have exercised their rights as rulers.
Whatever special rights the Welshmen had, were reserved until 1690, when
regular township officers were appointed. Goshen, Uwchlan, Tredyffren,
Whiteland, Newtown, Haverford, Radnor, and Merion,&mdash;the names these
ancient Britons gave to their townships&mdash;show what parts of the present
counties of Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery the Welsh tract covered.
Some of these people settled in Philadelphia and Bucks County. They
were chiefly Quakers, although Baptists were found among them.</p>

<p>The ship which bore Penn to America was the “Welcome.” The small-pox
made its appearance among the passengers when they had been out a
short time, and nearly one-third of them died. Two vessels which left
England after Penn had sailed, arrived before him; but at last, after a trying
voyage of nearly two months, the “Welcome” came within the Capes of
Delaware. Penn dated his arrival from the 24th of October, 1682, but it was
not until the 27th that the vessel lay opposite New Castle. The next day
he exhibited his deeds from the Duke of York, and took formal possession
of the town and surrounding country. He received a pledge of submission
from the inhabitants, issued commissions to six justices of the peace,
and empowered Markham to receive in his name possession of the country
below, which was done on November 7. The 29th of October (O. S.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
found him within the bounds of Pennsylvania, at the Swedish village of
Upland, the name of which, tradition says, he then changed to Chester.
From this point notices were sent out for the holding of a court at New
Castle on the 2d of November. At this meeting the inhabitants of the
counties of Delaware were told that their rights and privileges should be
the same as those of the citizens of Pennsylvania, and that an assembly
would be held as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>The attention which Penn gave to the constitution of his province was a
duty which had for him a particular interest. His thoughts had necessarily
dwelt much on the subject, and his experience had made him acquainted
with the principles of law and the abuses of government. The drafts of
this paper which have been preserved show how deeply it was considered.
Henry Sidney, Sir William Jones, and Counsellor Bamfield were consulted,
and portions of it were framed in accordance with the wishes of the Quakers.
In the Introduction to this remarkable paper, the ingenuousness of
its author is clearly discernible. Recognizing the necessity of government,
and tracing it to a divine origin, Penn continues,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“For particular frames and models, it will become me to say little, and comparatively
I will say nothing. My reasons are, first, that the age is too nice and difficult
for it, there being nothing the wits of men are more busy and divided upon....
Men side with their passions against their reason, and their sinister interests have so
strong a bias upon their minds, that they lean to them against the good of the things
they know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">“I do not find a model in the world that time, place, and some singular emergencies
have not necessarily altered, nor is it easy to frame a civil government that shall
serve all places alike. I know what is said by the several admirers of monarchy,
aristocracy, and democracy, which are the rule of one, a few, and many, and are the
three common ideas of government when men discourse on that subject. But I
choose to solve the controversy with this small distinction, and it belongs to all three,&mdash;any
government is free to the people under it (whatever be the frame) where the
laws rule and the people are a party to those laws; and more than this is tyranny,
oligarchy, or confusion.... Liberty without obedience is confusion, and obedience
without liberty is slavery.”</p>

<p>The good men of a nation, he argues, should make and keep its government,
and laws should bind those who make laws necessary. As wisdom
and virtue are qualities that descend not with worldly inheritances, care
should be taken for the virtuous education of youth.</p>

<p>The Frame of Government which followed these remarks was signed by
Penn on the 25th of April, 1682. By this Act the government was vested
in the governor and freemen, in the form of a provincial council and an
assembly. The provincial council was to consist of seventy-two members.
The first election of councilmen was to be held on the 20th of February,
1682-83, and they were to meet on the 10th of the following month. One-third
of the number were to retire each year when their successors were
chosen. An elaborate scheme was devised for forming the council into
committees to attend to various duties.</p>

<p>The assembly for the first year was to consist of all the freemen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
province, and after that two hundred were to be annually chosen. They
were to meet on April 20; the governor was to preside over the council.
Laws were to originate with the latter, and the chief duty of the assembly
was to approve such legislation. The governor and council were to see
the laws executed, inspect the treasury, determine the situation of cities
and ports, and provide for public schools.</p>

<p>On May 5 forty laws were agreed upon by the purchasers in England as
freemen of the province. By these all Christians, with the exception of
bound servants and convicts, who should take up land or pay taxes were
declared freemen. The merits of this proposed form, which was to be
submitted for approval to the first legislative body assembling in Pennsylvania,
have been widely debated. Professor Ebeling says it “was at first
too highly praised, and afterwards too lightly depreciated.” It was without
doubt too elaborate in some of its details, and the number proposed
for the council and assembly were out of all proportion to the wants of a
new country.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival, Penn found circumstances to require that the
laws should be put in force with as little delay as possible. He therefore
decided to call an assembly before the time provided, and extended to the
inhabitants of the Delaware counties the right to participate in it. Writs
were issued to the sheriffs of those parts to hold elections on the 20th
of November for the choice of delegates to meet at Chester on the 4th of
December, and the inhabitants of Pennsylvania were notified to attend.</p>

<p>The Assembly met at the appointed time. Upon petition from the lower
counties, an Act uniting them with Pennsylvania was passed, and at the
request of the Swedes a bill of naturalization became a law. Penn submitted
to the House the Frame of Government and the code of laws agreed
upon in England, together with a new series which he had prepared. In
doing this he acted without the advice of a provincial council. The laws
agreed upon in England, “more fully worded,” were passed, together with
such others as were thought to be necessary, and the Assembly adjourned
for twenty-one days. The members, however, do not appear to have met
again.</p>

<p>In January Penn issued writs for an election, to be held on the 20th of
February, of seventy-two members of the provincial council, and gave
notice that an assembly would be held as provided in the Frame of Government.
This was not strictly in accord with that document, as it provided
that the seventy-two councilmen should be chosen from the province
of Pennsylvania, and Penn made the passage apply equally to the Delaware
counties, over which he had had no jurisdiction at the time the Frame was
signed.</p>

<p>Before the election took place, it was discovered that the number proposed
for the council was much larger than could be selected, and that a
general gathering of the inhabitants would not furnish such an assembly
as the organization of the government demanded. On the suggestion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Penn twelve persons, therefore, were elected from each of the six counties;
and through their respective sheriffs the freemen petitioned the Governor
that as the number of the people was yet small, and but few were acquainted
with public business, those chosen should be accepted to represent them
in both council and assembly,&mdash;three in the former, and nine in the
latter. The Council met at the appointed time, the petitions of the freemen
were duly presented by the sheriffs, and the prayers granted by the
Governor. It was then moved by one of the members that, as the charter
granted by the Governor had again fallen into his hands by the negligence
of the freemen to fulfil their part, he should be asked that the alterations
which had been made should not affect their chartered rights. The Governor
answered that “they might amend, alter, or add for the Public good,
and he was ready to settle such foundations as might be for their happiness
and the good of their Posterities.” Those selected for the Assembly
then withdrew, and, although the time for them to meet had not arrived
(March 12), chose Thomas Wynne their
Speaker, and proceeded to business. During
the session an “Act of Settlement,” reciting the circumstances which made these
changes necessary, and reducing the number of members of the Provincial
Council and Assembly, was passed by the House, having been proposed by
the Governor and Council. By the Frame of Government first agreed
upon, Penn had surrendered his right to have an overruling voice in the
government, reserving for himself or representative a triple vote in the
Council. Fearing that his charter might be invalidated by some action of
the majority of the Council and Assembly, he now asked that the veto
power should be restored to him, which was accordingly done. The right
to appoint officers, which by the first Frame had been vested in the Governor
and Council, was given to Penn for life. Other laws necessary for good
government were enacted, and to the whole the Frame of Government was
appended, with modifications and such alterations as made it applicable
to the Delaware counties. On April 2, in the presence of the Council,
Assembly, and some of the citizens of Philadelphia, Penn signed and sealed
this new charter, solemnly assuring them that it was “solely by him intended
for the good and benefit of the freemen of the province, and prosecuted with
much earnestness in his spirit towards God at the time of its composure.”
It was received by the Speaker of the Assembly on behalf of the freemen;
and in their name that officer thanked the Governor for his great kindness
in granting them a charter “of more than was expected liberty.”</p>

<p>All that had been irregularly done was thus in a manner legalized; but
the matter was not allowed to pass unquestioned. Nicholas More was reprimanded
by the Council for having spoken imprudently regarding the
course which had been taken, and for saying that hundreds in England and
their children after them would curse them for what they had done.</p>

<p>Under the constitution and laws thus formed, the government was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
administered until 1696. The chief features of local government which
had existed under the Duke of York were lost sight of in the new order
of affairs, the authority being vested in the provincial or county officers
in place of those of the township. True to the doctrines which they
had preached, and to the demands which they had made of others, the
Quakers accorded to all a perfect liberty of conscience, intending, however,
“that looseness, irreligion, and Atheism” should not creep in under pretence
of conscience. The observance of the Sabbath was provided for.
On that day people were to “abstain from their usual and common toil and
labor, ... that they may better dispose themselves to read the Scriptures
of truth at home, or frequent such meetings of religious worship abroad as
may best suit their respective persuasions.” Profanity, drunkenness, health-drinking,
duelling, stage-plays, masques, revels, bull-baiting, cock-fighting,
cards, dice, and lotteries were all prohibited. Clamorous scolding and railing
were finable offences. The property of thieves was liable for fourfold
the value of what they had taken; and if they should have no estates, they
were to labor in prison until the person they had injured was satisfied. A
humane treatment of prisoners was insured. The poor were under the
protection of the county courts. Peacemakers were chosen in the several
counties to decide differences of a minor character. Malt liquors were not
to be sold at above two pennies sterling for a full Winchester quart. The
court records were to be kept in plain English characters, and laws were to
be taught in the schools.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“All judicial power, after Penn’s arrival, was vested in certain courts, the judges
of which were appointed by the Proprietary, presiding in the Provincial Council.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>“The practice in these courts was simple but regular. In criminal cases an indictment
was regularly drawn up, and a trial by jury followed. In civil cases the complications
of common-law pleading were disregarded. The filing of a simple statement
and answer put each cause at issue, and upon the trial the rules of evidence were not
observed. Juries were not always empanelled, the parties being frequently content to
leave the decision of their causes to the Court. In equity proceedings the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
was substantially that in vogue in the Court of Chancery, simplified to suit the requirements
of the province.</p>

<p>“Large judicial powers were also vested in the Provincial Council,&mdash;a state of
things not infrequently observed in the early stages of a country’s growth, before the
executive and judicial functions of government have been clearly defined. Prior to
the establishment of the Provincial Court, all cases of great importance, whether civil
or criminal, were tried before the Council. The principal trials thus conducted were
those of Pickering for coining, and of Margaret Mattson for witchcraft. The latter
terminated in a verdict of ‘guilty of having the common fame of being a witch, but
not guilty in manner and form as she stands indicted.’ This is the only regular prosecution
for witchcraft which is found in the annals of Pennsylvania. Prior to the
establishment of the Provincial Court, the Council also entertained appeals in certain
cases from the inferior courts. Subsequent to 1684, however, the extent of its
judicial power was limited to admiralty cases, to the administration of decedents’
estates, which, although more properly the business of the Orphans’ Courts, was often
neglected by those tribunals, and to the general superintendence and control of the
various courts, so as to insure justice to the suitors.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>“The legal knowledge among the early settlers was scanty. The religious tenets
of the Society of Friends rendered them very averse to lawyers, and distrustful of
them. There was, therefore, comparatively little demand for skilled advocates or
trained judges. John Moore and David Lloyd were almost the only professional
lawyers of the seventeenth century. Nicholas More, Abraham Man, John White,
Charles Pickering, Samuel Hersent, Patrick Robinson, and Samuel Jennings, with
some others, however, practised in the courts with some success; but by insensible
degrees, as population increased and the commercial interests of the community grew
more extensive and complicated, a trained Bar came into existence.”<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Markham not having agreed with Baltimore, 1681, regarding the boundaries
of Pennsylvania and Maryland, the two met again in September of
the following year at Upland, and Penn visited the latter at West River,
Dec. 13, 1682. In May, 1683, Penn again met Lord Baltimore at New Castle,
on the same business, but nothing was decided upon. This dispute was
a consequence of the lack of geographical information at the time their
grants were made. Baltimore’s patent was for the unoccupied land between
the Potomac and the fortieth degree of latitude, bounded on the east by
Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, with the exception of that part of
the Delaware peninsula which was south of a direct line drawn from
Watkin’s Point on the Chesapeake to the sea. The southern boundary of
Penn’s province was the fortieth degree and a circle of twelve miles around
New Castle. When both patents were issued, it was supposed that the
fortieth degree would fall near the head of Delaware Bay; but it was afterward
found to be so far to the northward as to cross the Delaware River at
the mouth of the Schuylkill. If the letter of the Maryland charter was
to interpret its meaning, Penn would be deprived of considerable river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
frontage, which it was clearly the intention of the Lords of Trade to grant
him; and he insisted that the boundary-line should be where it was <i>supposed</i>
the fortieth degree would be found. This was resisted by Baltimore,
who claimed ownership also to that part of the peninsula on the Delaware
which Penn had received from the Duke of York. To enforce his claims,
Baltimore sent to the Lords of Plantation a statement of what had taken
place between Penn and himself. He also ran a line in his own interest
between the provinces, and offered to persons who would take up land
in the Delaware counties under his authority more advantageous terms
than Penn gave. In 1684 Baltimore sent Colonel Talbot into the disputed
territory to demand it in his name, and then sailed for England to look
after his interests in that quarter.</p>

<p>Penn, when he learned all that had been done, wrote to the Lords of
Trade, giving his version of the transaction; but before long he found
the business would require his presence in England. Having empowered
his Council to act in his absence, he sailed August, 1684.</p>

<p>The Lords of Trade rendered a decision Nov. 7, 1685, which secured
to Penn the portion claimed by him of the Delaware peninsula, but which
left undefined the southern boundary of Pennsylvania. The Maryland
boundary was finally settled in 1760, upon an agreement which had been
entered into in 1732 between the heirs of Lord Baltimore and those of
Penn.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> By this a line was to be drawn westward from Cape Henlopen<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> to
a point half way between the bays of Delaware and Chesapeake. From
thence it was to run northward so as to touch the most western portion of
a circle of twelve miles radius around New Castle, and continue in a due
northerly course until it should reach the same latitude as fifteen English
statute miles directly south of the most southern
part of Philadelphia. From the point thus
gained the line was to extend due west. These
lines were surveyed by Charles Mason and
Jeremiah Dixon. They commenced their
work in 1763 and suspended it in 1767, when
they had reached a point two hundred and forty-four miles from the Delaware
River.</p>

<p>The Indians who inhabited Pennsylvania were of the tribe of the Lenni
Lenape. Some of them retained the noble characteristics of their race,
but the majority of them, through their intercourse with the Dutch, the
Swedes, and the English, had become thoroughly intemperate. Penn
desired that his dealings with them should be so just as to preserve the
confidence which Fox and Coale had inspired. Besides the letter written
by his commissioners, he had sent to them messages of friendship through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
Holme and others. In all the agreements he had entered into with purchasers,
the interests of the Indians had been protected; and he was far
in advance of his time in hoping to establish relations with them by which
all differences between the white men and the red should be settled by a
tribunal wherein both should be represented. The possibility of their
civilization under such circumstances was not absent from his mind, and in
his first contract with purchasers he stipulated that the Indians should have
“the same liberties to improve their grounds and provide for the sustenance
of their families as the planters.” Following the just precedent which had
been laid down by settlers in many parts of the country, and the advice of
the Bishop of London, he would allow no land to be occupied until the
Indian title had been extinguished. To obtain the land which was required
by the emigrants, a meeting with the principal Indian chiefs was held at
Shackamaxon June 23, 1683. The territory then purchased was considerable;
but what was of equal importance to the welfare of the infant colony
was the friendship then established with the aborigines. Poetry, Art, and
Oratory have pictured this scene with the elevating thoughts which belong
to each; but no more graphic representation of it has been made
than that which is suggested by the simple language of Penn used in
describing it. “When the purchase was agreed,” he writes, “great promises
passed between us of kindness and good neighborhood, and that the
Indians and English must live in love as long as the sun gave light.
Which done, another made a speech to the Indians in the name of all
the Sachamakers, or kings: first, to tell them what was done; next, to
charge and command them to love the Christians, and particularly live in
peace with me, and the people under my government; that many governors
had been in the river, but that no governor had come himself to
live and stay here before; and having now such an one that had treated
them well, they should never do him or his any wrong,&mdash;at every sentence
of which they shouted and said <i>amen</i> in their way.”<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“On the 6th of October, 1683, there arrived in Philadelphia, from Crefeld and its
neighborhood, a little colony of Germans. They were thirteen men with their families,
in all thirty-three persons, and they constituted the advance-guard of that immense
emigration which, confined at first to Pennsylvania, has since been spread over the
whole country. They were Mennonites, some of whom soon after, if not before, their
arrival, became identified with the Quakers. Most of them were linen-weavers.</p>

<p>Among the first to purchase lands upon the organization of the province were
several Crefeld merchants, headed by Jacob Telner, who secured fifteen thousand
acres. The purchasers also included a number of distinguished persons in Holland
and Germany, whose purchase amounted to twenty-five thousand acres, which became
vested in the Frankfort Land Company, founded in 1686. The eleven members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
this latter Company were chiefly Pietists and people of learning and influence, among
whom was the celebrated Johanna Eleanora von Merlau. Their original purpose was
to come to Pennsylvania themselves; but this plan was abandoned by all except
Francis Daniel Pastorius, a young lawyer, son of a judge at Windsheim, skilled in the
Greek, Latin, German, French, Dutch, English, and Italian languages, and carefully
trained in all the learning of the day. On the 24th of October, 1683, Pastorius, as
the agent for the Crefeld and Frankfort purchasers, began the location of Germantown.
Other settlers soon followed, and among them, in 1685, were several families from the
village of Krisheim, near Worms, where more than twenty years before the Quakers
had made some converts among the Mennonites, and had established a meeting. In
1688 Gerhard Hendricks, Dirck op den Graeff, Francis Daniel Pastorius, and Abraham
op den Graeff sent to the Friends’ Meeting a written protest against the buying and
selling of slaves. It was the first public effort made in this direction in America, and
is the subject of Whittier’s poem, <i>The Pennsylvania Pilgrim</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">The progress made in the settlement of the Province between 1681 and
1689 was remarkable, and was largely owing to Penn’s energy. On the 29th
of December, 1682, he wrote from Chester: “I am very well, ... yet busy
enough, having much to do to please all.... I am casting the country
into townships.” On the 5th of the next month he wrote: “I am day
and night spending my life, my time, my money, and am not a sixpence
enriched by this greatness.... Had I sought greatness, I had stayed at
home.” The English were the most numerous among the settlers; but in
1685, when the population numbered seven thousand two hundred, in which
French, Dutch, Germans, Swedes, Finns, and Scotch-Irish were represented,
Penn did not estimate his countrymen at above one half of the whole.</p>

<p>Twenty-three ships bearing emigrants arrived during the fall of 1682
and the winter following, and trading-vessels soon began to frequent the
Delaware. The counties of Philadelphia, Chester, and Bucks were organized
in the latter part of 1682, but were not surveyed until 1685. Philadelphia,
named before she was born, and first laid out in August or September,
1682,<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> contained in the following July eighty houses, such as they were,
and by the end of the year this number had increased to one hundred and
fifty. The founders of the city lived in caves dug out of the high embankment
by the river, and the houses which succeeded these primitive habitations
were probably of the very simple character described in Penn’s
advice to settlers.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> In July, 1683, a weekly post was established. Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
were carried from Philadelphia to the Falls of Delaware for 3<i>d.</i>, to Chester
2<i>d.</i>, to New Castle 4<i>d.</i>, to Maryland 6<i>d.</i> Notices of its departure were
posted on the Meeting-House doors and in other public places.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December of the same year the Council arranged with
Enoch Flower, who had had twenty years’ experience as a teacher in
England, to open a school. Four shillings per quarter was the charge for
those who were taught to read English; six shillings, when reading and
writing were studied; and eight shillings, when the casting of accounts
was added. For boarding scholars and “scooling,” he was to receive
“Tenn” pounds per annum.</p>

<p>The demand in trade at first was for articles of the greatest utility, like
mill and “grindle” stones, iron kettles, and hardware. One of the women
ordered shoes, and stipulated that they should be stout and large. James
Claypoole sent his silver-hafted knives to his brother in Barbadoes, and consigned
to him some beaver hats for which he could find at home no sale.
But in less than a year a trade sprang up with some of the West India
Islands, and rum, sugar, and negroes were ordered, in exchange for pipe-staves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
and horses. The silver from a Spanish wreck and peltries furnished
the means of an exchange with Europe, and soon word was sent out to
send “linnen, serges, crape, and Bengall, and other slight stuffs; but send
no more shoes, gloves, stockings, nor hats.” Before Penn sailed for England
in 1684, Philadelphia contained three hundred and fifty-seven houses,
many of them three stories high, with cellars and balconies. Samuel
Carpenter, one of the most enterprising of the early merchants, had a
quay at which a ship of five hundred tons could lie. Trades of all kinds
flourished; vessels had been built; brick houses soon began to be seen;
and shop windows enlivened the streets.</p>

<p>In 1685 William Bradford established his printing-press in Philadelphia,
the first in the middle colonies of North America. Its earliest issue was
an almanac entitled the <i>Kalendarium Pennsilvaniense</i>, printed in 1685 for
the succeeding year.</p>

<p>By 1690 brick and stone houses were the kind usually erected, while
only the poorer classes built of wood. Manufactures also began to flourish.
That year William Ryttenhouse, Samuel Carpenter, William Bradford, and
others built a paper mill on the Schuylkill. The woollen manufactures
offered such encouragement that there was “a public flock of sheep in the
town, and a sheepheard or two to attend them.” The rural districts were
also prosperous. The counties were divided into townships of about five
thousand acres, in the centre of which villages were laid out. In 1684 there
were fifty such settlements in the colony. At first the cattle were turned
loose, and the ear-marks of their respective owners were registered at the
county courts. Roads were surveyed and bridges built. The first mill
was started in 1683 at Chester by Richard Townsend and others. The
reports regarding the crops show them to have been enormous for the
labor bestowed, and the development of the whole country seems to have
been correspondent to the increased wealth of Philadelphia, where, in 1685,
the poorest lots were worth four times what they cost, and the best forty-fold.
At the beginning of the year 1684 Penn wrote: “I have led the
greatest colony into America that ever any man did upon a private credit,
and the most prosperous beginnings that ever were in it are to be found
among us.”</p>

<p>The early ecclesiastical annals of Pennsylvania are meagre. The wave
of religious excitement which swept over England during the days of the
Commonwealth spent itself on the banks of the Delaware. Men and women
with intellects too weak to grasp the questions which moved them, or possibly
instigated by cunning, wandered through the country prophesying or
disputing. One declared “that she was Mary the mother of the Lord;”
another, “that she was Mary Magdalen, and others that they were Martha,
John, etc.,&mdash;scandalizers,” wrote a traveller in 1679, “as we heard them in a
tavern, who not only called themselves, but claimed to be, really such.”</p>

<p>The Swedish congregations, neglected by the churches in Sweden, were
in 1682 falling into decay. The congregations at Tranhook, near Upland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
and at Tinnicum, were under the charge of Lars Lock, that at Wicaco
under Jacob Fabritius. The former was a cripple, the latter blind. Their
salaries were scantily paid, and they were miserably poor. The Dutch had
but one church, which was at New Castle.</p>

<p>The first meeting of Quakers for religious worship in Pennsylvania was
no doubt held at the house of Robert Wade, near Upland. William Edmundson,
the Quaker preacher, speaks of such meetings in 1675. It was
then that Wade came to America with Fenwick. In Bucks County meetings
are said to have been held as early as 1680 at the houses of Quakers
who had settled there. The first meeting near Philadelphia was at Shackamaxon,
at the house of Thomas Fairman, in 1682; but it was soon removed
to Philadelphia, where one was established in 1683. Early in that year no
less than nine established meetings existed in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As early as 1684 or 1685 the Baptists established a church at Cold Spring,
in Bucks County, about three miles above Bristol. The pastor was the Rev.
Thomas Dungan. In 1687 they established a second congregation at Pennepeck,
in Philadelphia County, of which the Rev. Elias Keach was the
first minister. The Episcopalians and Presbyterians did not own places
of worship until a later date.</p>

<p>The early political annals of the colony show a condition of affairs perfectly
consistent with the circumstances under which the constitution was
formed. While Penn remained in the country his presence prevented any
excess such as might be expected from men
inexperienced in self-government. In 1684,
however, Penn was obliged to return to England,
and he empowered the Provincial Council
to act in his stead. Thomas Lloyd was
the president of that body, and was also
commissioned Keeper of the Seal. He was
a man of prudence, and seems to have justified the confidence placed in
him by Penn. Arrogance on the part of some of the other officers of the
government soon awakened feelings of jealousy among the people, who were
prompt to resent any violation of their rights. Nicholas More, the Chief-Justice,
was impeached by the Assembly for gross partiality and overbearing
conduct. He was styled by the Speaker an “aspiring and corrupt minister
of state,” and the Council was requested to remove him from office. He
was expelled from the Assembly, of which he was a member, for having
thrice entered his protest against a single bill. Patrick Robinson, the clerk
of the Court, refused to submit to the House the records of the Court in the
case of More, and was restrained for his “divers insolences and affronts.”
When brought before the Assembly, he stretched himself at full length on
the ground, and refused to answer questions put to him, telling the House
that it “acted arbitrarily” and without authority. The Council was also
requested to remove him; but neither in his case nor in that of More were
the prayers granted. “I am sorry at heart for your animosities,” wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
Penn, when he heard of these troubles; “cannot more friendly and private
courses be taken to set matters to rights in an infant province whose steps
are numbered and watched? For the love of God, me, and the poor country,
be not so <i>governmentish</i>, so noisy and open in your dissatisfactions.”
It was the love of government, the seeds of which Penn had himself planted,
which caused these troubles, and he it was who was to suffer most in that
period of political growth. Hundreds, he said, had been prevented from
emigrating by these quarrels, and that they had been to him a loss of
£10,000. His quit-rents, which in 1686 should have amounted to £500
per annum, were unpaid. They were looked upon as oppressive taxes, for
which the Proprietary had no need; but the year previous he wrote: “God
is my witness.... I am above six thousand pounds out of pocket more
than ever I saw by the province.”</p>

<p>The want of energy shown by the Council in managing his affairs caused
Penn to lessen the number in which the executive authority rested. In
1686 he commissioned five of the Council, three of whom were to be a
quorum, to attend to his proprietary affairs. By the slothful manner in
which the Council had conducted the public business, the charter, he
argued, had again fallen into his hands, and he threatened to dissolve the
Frame of Government “if further occasion be given.” Under these commissioners
but little improvement was made, and in 1688 Penn appointed
Captain John Blackwell his lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Earliest Tracts and Books.</span>&mdash;During the first thirty years after the granting

his grant. “It is introduced by a preface of some length, being an argument

settle it. Information for those desiring to emigrate, and extracts from the royal charter,

The latter edition contains
also letters of Penn to Friends in Holland and Germany prior to his receiving his
grant, which fact tends to show that
the relations he had established by his
travels there attracted the attention of
persons in Germany to his efforts in
America.</p>

César de Rochefort’s account,<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> which

George Fox. It was written in favor of Quaker emigration at a time when many Quakers
feared that such action might be prompted by a desire to escape persecution. In it we
have the earliest descriptions preserved of Pennsylvania after it was given to Penn. These
are presented in letters of Markham,
written soon after his arrival,
the date of which is also
indicated. The extracts from
Markham’s letters are printed in

<p>The constitution which Penn
proposed for his colony, together
with certain laws which were accepted
by purchasers in England
as citizens of Pennsylvania,
were issued the same year as <i>The
Frame of Government</i>.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Both
constitution and laws underwent
considerable alteration before
going into effect; although this
fact has been frequently overlooked.
A little brochure, of
probably a like date, <i>Information
and Direction</i>,<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> covers a
description of the houses which
it was supposed would be the
most convenient for settlers to
build.</p>

<p>The Free Society of Traders
purchased of Penn twenty thousand
acres. The Society was
formed for the purpose of developing
this tract, which was to
be known as the Manor of
Frank. Nicholas More was
president, and James Claypoole
treasurer. The letter-book of
the latter is in the Historical
Society of Pennsylvania. The
charter of the Society will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
found in Hazard’s <i>Annals</i> (p.
541), with other information regarding

of a tract<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> which is printed in
full with a reduced fac-simile of
titlepage in <i>Pennsylvania Magazine
of History</i>, v. 37.</p>

<p><i>A Vindication of William
Penn</i>, by Philip Ford, in two
folio pages, was published in
London in 1683, to contradict
stories which were circulated
after Penn had sailed, to the
effect that he had died upon
reaching America, and had
closed his career professing belief
in the Church of Rome. It
contains abstracts of the first
letters written by Penn from
America.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>The most important of all
the series is a <i>Letter from William
Penn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> printed in 1683.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
It was written after Penn had been in America over nine months (dated August 16), and
may be considered as a report from personal observation of what he found his colony to be.
It passed through at least two editions in London; one of which contains a list of the
property-holders in Philadelphia, with numbers affixed to their names indicating the lots
they held, as is shown on a plan of that city which accompanies the publication, and of
which a heliotype is herewith given. The letter appeared the next year (1684) in a Dutch
translation<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> (two editions). Of the same date is a new description of the province, of
which we have a German<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and a French<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> text. The pamphlet contains an extended
extract from Penn’s letter to the Free Society of Traders, the letter of Thomas Paschall
from Philadelphia, dated Feb. 10, 1683 (N. S.), and other interesting papers, many of which
were published in <i>A Brief Account</i>. All information in it that is not readily accessible
has been lately translated by Mr. Samuel W. Pennypacker from the French edition, and
is printed with fac-simile of title in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>, vi. 311.</p>

<p>A small tract, giving letters from a Dutch and Swiss sojourner in and near Philadelphia,
was printed at Rotterdam, in 1684, as <i>Twee Missiven</i>.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> The only copy of this tract
which we know of is in the Library of Congress, and will be shortly published by the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania. The copy at Washington, we are told, contains but
one letter. Another, or possibly the same, copy is catalogued in Trömel’s <i>Bibliotheca
Americana</i>, Leipzig (1861), no. 390.</p>

<p>The <i>Planter’s Speech</i><a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> (1684) and Thomas Budd’s <i>Good Order established in Pennsylvania,
etc.</i> (1685),<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> which have been referred to in another chapter, are of like importance
to Pennsylvania history. What is called “William Bradford’s Printed Letter” (1685) is
quoted in the first edition of Oldmixon’s <i>British Empire in America</i>, p. 158. We have,
however, never met with the original publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>Another Dutch description of the country was printed the same year (1685) at Rotterdam,
<i>Missive van Cornelis Bom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> and has become very rare.</p>

<p>In 1685 Penn also printed <i>A Further Account</i> of his grant, signing his name to the
tract, which appeared in quarto in separate editions of twenty and sixteen pages, followed
the same year by a Dutch translation.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> After Penn’s letter to the Free Society (1683)
this is the most important of these early tracts.</p>

<p>In 1686 the series only shows a brief Dutch tract;<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> but in 1687 we derive from <i>A
Letter from Dr. More</i>,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> <i>etc</i>., partly the work of Nicholas More, president of the Free
Society of Traders, an idea of the growth of the province at that date. Of a similar
character is a tract printed four years later (1691), <i>Some Letters</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> In the following
year (1692) we have a poetical description<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> of the province, which contains many interesting
facts. Little is known of the author, Richard Frame. It is said that he was a teacher
in the Friends’ School of Philadelphia. He was certainly a resident of Pennsylvania, and
the first of her citizens to give his thoughts to the public in the form of verse. The first
four lines will suffice to show its merits as a poem:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“To all our Friends that do desire to know<br />
What Country ‘t is we live in&mdash;this will show.<br />
Attend to hear the Story I shall tell:<br />
No doubt but you will like this country well.”</p>

<p class="p1">The pamphlet was a colonial production. It appeared on paper which was possibly made
here, and was printed by William Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the appearance of Frame’s verses, the poetic fever seized upon John Holme,
and he wrote “A true Relation of the Flourishing State of Pennsylvania.” The poetic
taste of the community was either satiated by the effort of Frame, or Holme shrank from
the honors of authorship, for his poem did not see the light until published by the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania in the thirteenth number of its <i>Bulletin</i> in 1847.</p>

<p>In 1695 one of the party who emigrated with Kelpius gave the public an account of
his voyage and arrival,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> under the pseudonym of “N. N.” He dated his letter “from
Germantown, in the Antipodes, Aug. 7, 1694.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>In addition to Mr. Whitehead’s remarks regarding Gabriel Thomas’s <i>Account of
Pennsylvania</i> (see chap. xi.), we will add that the portion relating to Pennsylvania
covers fifty-five pages, besides eight pages which are devoted to the preface and title. A
person by the name of the author, probably the same, was in America in 1702, and was
then solicitous of a commission as collector of quit-rents, etc., within the county of Newcastle.
In 1698 he inveighed against George Keith and his followers, and in 1702 sided
with Colonel Quarry in his disputes with Penn. Most of the statements in his book can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
be relied on, but some passages are marked by exaggeration and others by satire. As
some of the buildings in Philadelphia mentioned by Thomas were not erected until after
he wrote, Mr. Westcott, in his <i>History of Philadelphia</i>, suggests that possibly there was
more than one edition of the work bearing the same date.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>In 1700 was printed a <i>Beschreibung der Provintz Pennsylvaniæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> the work of Francis
Daniel Pastorius, agent of the Frankfort Land Company, and the most active and intelligent
of the first German settlers, which is of great interest, as it contains the views of one
thoroughly identified with the German movement to America. The descriptions of the
country and of the form of government, the advice to emigrants, etc., which it contains,
are gathered from letters written to his father. A translation of portions of the work by
Lewis H. Weiss is given in <i>Memoir of Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. iv. part
ii. p. 83. The original edition is generally found bound up with a German edition of
Thomas’s <i>Pennsylvania</i>, printed in 1702, and the tract by Falkner hereafter mentioned.
While the works bear different dates, there appears to have been some connection in the
series. The information in Thomas, originally printed in 1698, supplements to a great
extent what will be found in Pastorius, printed in 1700. The titlepage of the German
edition of Thomas (1702) speaks of it, therefore, as a continuation of Pastorius, and the
same shows Falkner’s tract to have appeared as a supplement to the German edition of
Thomas.</p>

<p>An agent of the Frankfort Company, who was in Pennsylvania in 1694 and 1700,
issued at Frankfort in 1702 a little book, <i>Curieuse Nachricht</i>,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> which gives some information
in the form of questions and answers, one hundred and three in number. The subjects
touched upon are the country in general, its soil, climate, etc; the inhabitants, their
manners, customs, and religions; the Indians; how to go to America, etc.</p>

<p>The last of the works to be considered as original authority is J. Oldmixon’s <i>British
Empire in America</i>, as it is known that the author got some of his information from
Penn himself.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> It was first issued at London in 1708, and again in 1741. The editions
differ materially in the sections on Pennsylvania, so that both need to be consulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The Rise and Progress of the Quakers.</span>&mdash;As we have traced the history of
Penn’s colony from the origin of the religious society which had such an influence on the
formation of his character, and to which Pennsylvania owes its existence quite as much
as to Penn himself, a few references must be made to the chief sources of information
from which a history of the Quakers can be gathered. The most prominent of these is
the <i>Journal of George Fox</i>,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> the founder of the Quaker Church. It relates, in passages
of alternate vividness and ambiguity, the experiences of his life. So different, however,
are the opinions entertained, that while Macaulay says that “his gibberish was translated
into English, meanings which he would have been unable to comprehend were put on his
phrases, and his system so much improved that he would not have known it again,” Sir
James Mackintosh, on the contrary, calls the <i>Journal</i> “one of the most extraordinary and
instructive narratives in the world, which no reader of competent judgment can peruse without
revering the virtues of the writer, pardoning his self-delusions, and ceasing to smile at
his peculiarities.”</p>

<p>W. Edmundson made three voyages to America before 1700, the first with Fox, in
1671; his <i>Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> has been often printed.</p>

<p>Penn’s own statements about the sect’s origin were given in his <i>Brief Account of the
Rise and Progress of the People called Quakers</i>, published at London in 1695, and in his
<i>Primitive Christianity Revived</i>, 1696 and 1699.</p>

<p>Robert Barclay is considered the most able exponent of the Quaker belief among early
writers of that sect, and his <i>Apology</i><a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> is his chief work. He was the son of “Barclay of
Ury,” of whom Whittier has sung, and was governor of East Jersey (see chap. xi.).</p>

<p><i>The Sufferings of the People called Quakers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> by Joseph Besse, is, as its title indicates,
an account of their persecutions in various parts of the world. It is written from a
Quaker standpoint, but its accuracy can seldom be questioned. It has passed through
two editions.</p>

<p>Sewel’s <i>History of the Quakers</i><a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> is a work which possesses great value, not only on
account of its freedom from error, but because it was written at an early period in the history
of the Society of Friends. Its author was a native of Amsterdam, and was born about
1650. His history was written to correct the misrepresentations in <i>Historia Quakeriana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
by Gerard Croese, which had been largely circulated. Sewel’s work was published in
Dutch at Amsterdam in 1717, and a translation by the author was issued in London,
1722. Gough’s <i>History of the Quakers</i> is a compilation of nearly all that was accessible
at the time of its publication. The <i>Portraiture of Quakerism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> by Clarkson, treats of the
discipline and customs of the Society. The <i>History of Friends in the Seventeenth
Century</i>, by Dr. Charles Evans, contains nearly everything that most readers will require.
It is an excellent compilation, and presents the subject in a compact, useful form. The
same can be said of a <i>History of the Religious Society of Friends from its rise to the
year 1828</i>,<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> by Samuel M. Janney. The author was a follower of Elias Hicks, and his
work contains a history of the separation of the meetings caused by the doctrines
preached by the latter. In Barclay’s <i>Inner Life of the Religious Societies of the Commonwealth</i><a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
the attempt has been made to trace the origin of the Society of Friends to
an earlier period than the preaching of Fox. The author of the work was Robert
Barclay, of the same family as “the Apologist.” The work, which is an able one,
was reviewed by Dr. Charles Evans.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> A terse criticism was lately made on the book
by a Friend, who in conversation remarked, “Robert Barclay seemed to know more
of what George Fox believed than George himself.”</p>

<p>The chief manuscript depository of the Friends is in Devonshire House, Friends’
Meeting-House, 12 Bishopsgate Street Without, London, E.C., England, where what is
known as the Swarthmore manuscripts are preserved. The collection was made under the
direction of George Fox, and many of the papers are indorsed in his handwriting. It
consists “of letters addressed to Swarthmore Hall from the Preachers in connection with
Fox, giving an account of their movements and success, to Margaret Fell, and through
her to Fox. Up to 1661 Swarthmore Hall was secure from violation, and these letters
range over the period from 1651 to 1661.”</p>

<p>John Whiting’s <i>Catalogue of Friends’ Books</i>, published in 1708, is the earliest gathering
of titles concerning the Quakers. The work, however, has been fully done in our
own day by Joseph Smith, who published, in 1867, at London, <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of
Friends’ Books</i>, in two volumes, with critical remarks and occasional biographical notices;
and in 1873, his <i>Bibliotheca Anti-Quakeriana; or, a Catalogue of Books adverse to the
Society of Friends; with Biographical Notices of the Authors: with Answers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>In following the history of the Quakers, particularly in America, the recorder of their
career in Pennsylvania must leave unnamed some of the most important books, because
their contents concern chiefly or solely the story of their persecutions and progress in the
other colonies, particularly New England.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Bowden’s <i>History of Friends in America</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
it is the most important of the late works, must also be mentioned. Its author enjoyed
great advantages in preparing it, having the manuscripts deposited in Devonshire House
at his command. In it many original documents of the greatest interest are printed for
the first time, among which we may mention a letter of Mary Fisher to George Fox, from
Barbadoes, dated Jan. 30, 1655, regarding Quaker preachers coming to America, and of
Josiah Coale to the same person, in 1660, in relation to the purchase of a tract of land,
now a portion of Pennsylvania. The work is spirited and readable, and while it is written
in entire sympathy with the Quakers, its statements are so carefully weighed that but little
exception can be taken to them, and then only in cases where the fundamental views of
the author and of his readers are at variance.</p>

<p>A defence of the early Friends in America will be found in <i>Colonial History of the
Eastern and some of the Southern States</i>, by Job R. Tyson; see <i>Memoirs of Historical
Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. iv. part ii. p. 5. For the colonies other than New England,
a few references will suffice. For New York, O’Callaghan’s <i>History of New Netherland</i>
and Brodhead’s <i>New York</i> can be consulted. For those at Perth Amboy, 1686-1688, see
<i>Historical Magazine</i>, xvii. 234. The <i>Annals of Hempstead</i>, by Henry Onderdonk, Jr.,
treats of the Quakers on Long Island and in New York from 1657 to 1826; cf. also the
<i>American Historical Record</i>, i. 49; ii. 53, 73. <i>The Early Friends (or Quakers) in
Maryland</i>, by J. Saurin Norris, and <i>Wenlock Christison and the Early Friends in Talbot
County, Maryland</i>, by Samuel A. Harrison, are the titles of instructive addresses delivered
before the Maryland Historical Society, and included in its Fund publications; compare
also E. D. Neill’s “Francis Howgill and the Early Quakers,” in his <i>English Colonization
in North America</i>, chap. xvii., and his <i>Terra Mariæ</i>, chap. iv. Henning’s <i>Statutes at
Large</i> give the laws passed in Virginia to punish the Quakers. The <i>Journals</i> and <i>Travels</i>
of Burnyeat, Edmundson, and Fox should also be consulted. A far from flattering picture of
the Quakers living on the Delaware shortly before the settlement of Pennsylvania, will be
found in the <i>Journal</i> of Dankers and Sluyter, two followers of John Labadie, who travelled
in America in 1679-1680. Their account of the condition of the country on the Delaware
at that time is very interesting.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> <i>A Retrospect of Early Quakerism: being Extracts from
the Records of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, etc.</i>, by Ezra Michener, Philadelphia, 1860,
is also a useful work, as it gives the dates when meetings were established.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">William Penn.</span>&mdash;The collected works of William Penn have passed through four
editions;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> these contain but few of his letters in relation to Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> The
biographical sketch which accompanies the edition of 1726 is attributed to Joseph Besse.
It appeared but eight years after Penn’s death, and has been the groundwork of nearly
everything which has since been written concerning him. The <i>Memoirs of the Private
and Public Life of William Penn</i>, by Thomas Clarkson,<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> was for many years the standard
Life. Later evidence has shown that in some particulars the author erred; but it is generally
accurate. It however treats more of William Penn the Quaker than of William
Penn the founder of Pennsylvania. The same criticism is applicable to <i>The Life of
William Penn</i> by Samuel M. Janney.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> It also is a trustworthy book. All that was in
print at the time it was written was used in its preparation, and it is to-day, historically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
the best work on the subject. It contains more of his letters regarding the settlement of
Pennsylvania than any other work we know of, and they are given in full. The “Life of
William Penn,” by George E. Ellis, D.D., in Sparks’s <i>American Biography</i>, second series,
vol. xii., is an important and spirited production, the result of careful thought and study.</p>

<p><i>William Penn: an Historical Biography</i>,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> by William Hepworth Dixon, is probably
the most popular account that has appeared. Its style is agreeable, and it is full of interesting
facts picturesquely grouped. In some cases, however, the authorities quoted do not
support the inferences which have been drawn from them, and the historical value of the
book has been sacrificed in order to add to its attractiveness. Those chapters which
speak of the interest taken by Algernon Sidney in the formation of the constitution of
Pennsylvania are clearly erroneous. These views are based on the part which Penn took
in Sidney’s return to Parliament, and in a letter of Penn to Sidney, Oct. 13, 1681.
Without this last, the argument falls. No reference is given to where the letter will be
found. It was first printed as addressed to Algernon Sidney, in vol. iii. part i. p. 285 of
the <i>Memoirs of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>. In vol. iv. ibid. (part i. pp. 167-212)
other letters of Penn are printed, one of which is addressed to Henry Sidney, the
brother of Algernon. To this a note is appended, stating that the letter in the former
volume was undoubtedly written to the same person. As Mr. Dixon used extracts from
these letters, it was, to say the least, unfortunate that he should have overlooked the importance
of the note. <i>La Vie de Guillaume Penn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> par J. Marsillac, is a meritorious
compilation, but its chief interest centres around its author, who styles himself “Député
extraordinaire des Amis de France à l’Assemblée Nationale, etc.” He was of noble birth,
and an officer in the French army. He joined the Friends in 1778. Being convinced of
the unlawfulness of war by the arguments in Barclay’s <i>Apology</i>, he determined “to change
his condition of a destroyer to that of a preserver of mankind,” and studied medicine.
During the French Revolution he took refuge in America, and resided in Philadelphia. He
afterward returned to France, “and threw off at the same time the garb and profession of
a Friend. He devoted himself in Paris to the practice of his profession, and obtained
under Napoleon a situation in one of the French hospitals.”</p>

<p>Chapters in Janney’s <i>Life of Penn</i> and in Dixon’s <i>Biography</i> are devoted to a refutation
of the charges of worldliness and insincerity brought against Penn by Macaulay in
his <i>History of England</i>. We append below the titles of other publications of the same
character, as well as of additional works which can be consulted with profit by students
of his life.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> The <i>Penn Papers</i>, or manuscripts in the possession of the Historical Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
of Pennsylvania, relate chiefly to the history of the province while under the governorship
of Penn’s descendants. There are, however, in the collection some papers of personal
interest in relation to Penn, and some of his controversial writings and documents connected
with the history of the province at the time of its settlement. The history of
this collection presents another instance of the perils to which manuscripts are exposed.
After having been preserved for a number of years by one branch of the Penn family with
comparative care, subject only to the depredations of time, they were sold to a papermaker,
through whose discrimination they were preserved. They were catalogued and
offered for sale by Edward G. Allen and James Coleman, of London, in 1870.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The collections
were purchased by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, but not until some
papers had been obtained by persons more favorably situated. The general interest of
the whole, however, was but little lessened by this misfortune. From 1700 until the
Revolution the series is remarkably complete, and there are but few incidents in the
colonial history of Pennsylvania that cannot be elucidated by its examination. A portion
of the papers (about twenty thousand documents) have been bound and arranged,
and fill nearly seventy-five folio volumes.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">General Histories of Pennsylvania.</span>&mdash;The first historian of Pennsylvania was
Samuel Smith, author of the well-known <i>History of New Jersey</i>; but his work up to the
present time has not appeared in a complete form. It is a history of the Society of
Friends, or Quakers, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Smith’s manuscripts are in the
Library of the New Jersey Historical Society. What appears to be a duplicate of the
Pennsylvania portion is in that of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Hazard printed
the latter in his <i>Register of Pennsylvania</i>, vols. vi. and vii.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>Robert Proud’s <i>History of Pennsylvania</i><a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> has long enjoyed a high reputation, but no
more so than its merits entitle it to. For years it was the only history of the State. In
its preparation the manuscript of Smith’s <i>History</i> was used, and in it extracts are given
from pamphlets that have since been printed in full. Nevertheless, there is much in it
that cannot be found elsewhere. Passages are quoted from letters of Penn which have
never been printed entire, and the notes regarding the early settlers are of especial value.
The care taken in the preparation of the book is so evident that its statements can as
a rule be accepted. The author, a native of England, was a teacher of the classics in
the Friends’ School, Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>Professor Ebeling’s volume on Pennsylvania in his <i>Erdbeschreibung und Geschichte
von America</i>, Hamburg, 1793-1799, in five volumes, is another valuable contribution.
Portions of it, translated by Duponceau, will be found in Hazard’s <i>Register of Pennsylvania</i>,
i. 340, 353, 369, 385, 401.</p>

<p>Thomas F. Gordon’s <i>History of Pennsylvania</i><a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> gives the history of the colony down
to the Declaration of Independence. That part which treats of the eighteenth century does
so more fully than any other work. It has never enjoyed much popularity. Its style is
labored. The author was one who thought that “the names of the first settlers are interesting
to us only because they were first settlers,” and that nothing could attract the
public in men “whose chief, and perhaps sole, merit consisted in the due fulfilment of
the duties of private life.” There is a tone of antagonism to Penn in some parts of the
book which lacks the spirit of impartiality. It was reviewed by Job R. Tyson. See
“Examination of the Various Charges brought by Historians against William Penn,” etc.,&mdash;<i>Memoirs
of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. ii. part ii. p. 127.</p>

<p>The second volume of Bowden’s <i>History of Friends in America</i><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> is the best Quaker
history of Pennsylvania that has appeared.</p>

<p>Sherman Day’s <i>Historical Collections</i> (1843) and <i>An Illustrated History of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania</i>,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> by William H. Egle, M.D., both give the history of the State
down to the time of their respective publications. In them the histories of the counties
are treated in separate chapters, general histories of the State being given by way of
introductions,&mdash;that by Dr. Egle being very full.</p>

<p><i>The Historical Review of the Constitution and Government of Pennsylvania, from its
Origin</i>, which is attributed to Franklin, belongs properly to a later period of the history of
the province than we are now considering, and, as it was written to serve a political purpose,
has but slight historical claims. In it, however, the attempt is made to trace some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
of the alleged abuses of power back to the foundation of the colony. It was published in
London in 1759, and is included by both Duane and Sparks in their editions of Franklin’s
writings.</p>

<p>Bancroft’s chapters on the Quakers in the United States and on Pennsylvania are
excellent. Grahame’s <i>Colonial History of the United States</i> is less flattering in the estimate
given of Penn and his followers, although far from unappreciative of their efforts. Burke’s
<i>Account of the European Settlements in America</i><a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> gives nothing that is new in connection
with the settlement of Pennsylvania; but the opinions of its distinguished author in regard
to William Penn as a legislator will be read with pleasure by Penn’s admirers. The remarks
on the settlement of Pennsylvania in Wynne’s <i>General History of the British
Empire in America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> are copied bodily from Burke; but no quotation marks are given,
and nothing indicates their origin. Douglass’s <i>Summary</i> gives nothing on the subject
that will not be found in the charter and a few documents of similar character. From
William M. Cornell’s <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>, 1876, nothing new will be gathered regarding
the settlement of the province. It is a mere compilation, in which Weems’s <i>Life
of Penn</i> is quoted as an authority.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Local Histories.</span>&mdash;It is only in the history of the counties first settled that information
on the period treated of in this chapter can be sought. John F. Watson’s <i>Annals of
Philadelphia</i><a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> is one of the chief authorities. The plan of the work is not one that can be
approved of at the present day, as sufficient care has not been taken in all cases to follow
the original language of documents quoted, or to give references to authorities. Nevertheless,
it is doubtful if any work in America has done more to cultivate a taste for
historical study. There is a charm about its gossipy pages which has attracted to it
thousands of readers, and provoked more serious investigations. It contains much
regarding the domestic life of the first settlers and the building of Philadelphia which
has been universally accepted, and many traditions gathered from old persons which there
is no reason to question. The most important History of Philadelphia is that by Mr.
Thompson Westcott, now printing in the columns of the <i>Sunday Despatch</i>. Eight hundred
and ten chapters have appeared up to the present time. It is an encyclopædia on
the subject. Some of the early chapters treat of the period under review. <i>A History of
the Townships of Byberry and Moreland, in Philadelphia County</i>, by Joseph C. Martindale,
M.D.,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> treats largely of the earliest settlers in that section of the State. The present
Montgomery County is formed of a portion of the original County of Philadelphia, and
the history of some of its sections treats of the settlement of the colony. For such
information, see <i>History of Montgomery County, within Schuylkill Valley</i>,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> by William
J. Buck. Mr. Buck prepared also the Historical Introduction to Scott’s <i>Atlas of Montgomery
County</i>, Philadelphia, 1877. The <i>History of Delaware County</i>, by George Smith,
M.D.,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> is by far the best county history of Pennsylvania yet published. It is thoroughly
trustworthy, and treats fully of the settlement of the county. Extracts from the records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
of Markham’s court are given in it. <i>Chester and its Vicinity, Delaware County, Pennsylvania</i>,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
by John Hill Martin, is a meritorious work.</p>

<p>The history of Bucks County has been twice written; first by William J. Buck, in
1855. His investigations were contributed to a county paper, and were subsequently
published in a volume of one hundred and eighteen pages, to which was appended a
<i>History of the Township of Wrightstown</i>, by Charles W. Smith, M.D., contained in
twenty-four pages. A later <i>History of Bucks County</i>,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> is that by General W. W. H.
Davis, an excellent work.</p>

<p>The <i>History of Chester County, Pennsylvania</i>,<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> by J. Smith Futhey and Gilbert Cope,
is a work of merit, being the production of two thorough students, deeply imbued with
the love of their subject. The historical and genealogical portions of it are written with
care and judgment. It contains extracts from the records of the first courts held in
Pennsylvania.</p>

The royal charter is given in <i>Votes of Assembly</i>, vol. i. p. xviii; Hazard’s <i>Annals</i>, p. 488;
<i>Colonial Records</i>, vol. i. (1st ed.) p. ix, (2d ed.) p. 17; Hazard’s <i>Register</i>, i. 293. A fac-simile

July 11, 1681, will be found in Hazard’s <i>Annals</i>, p. 516, <i>Colonial Records</i>, vol. i. (1st ed.),

printed in Hazard’s <i>Annals</i>, p. 527. The original paper is in the possession of the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania. His instructions to his fourth commissioner, William
Haige, are in Hazard’s <i>Annals of Pennsylvania</i>, p. 637. The Frame of Government
and laws agreed upon in England May 5, 1682, were printed at the time. They are also
given in Hazard’s <i>Annals</i>, p. 558, <i>Colonial Records</i>, vol. i. (1st ed.) p. xxi (2d ed.) p. 29,
<i>Votes of the Assembly</i>, vol. i. p. xxvii, <i>Duke of York’s Laws</i>, p. 91, and Proud’s <i>Pennsylvania</i>,

etc., in the <i>Penn Papers</i> of the Historical Society. One of these is indorsed as the
work of Counsellor Bamfield; another bears the name of C. Darnall. Oldmixon says
(edition of 1708) that “the Frame” was the work of “Sir William Jones and other
famous men of the Long Robe.” Penn’s letter to Henry Sidney (Oct. 13, 1681) shows
that Sidney was consulted regarding it; and Chalmers says (on the authority of Markham),
that portions of it were formed to suit the Quakers.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Landing of Penn.</span>&mdash;In 1824 a society was formed in Philadelphia for the commemoration
of the landing of William Penn. Its first meeting was held November 4, in
the house in which he had once lived, in Letitia Court. An address was delivered by Peter
S. Duponceau, and the eighteen members of the Society dined together. In selecting the
day to be celebrated, the Society was guided by the passage in Penn’s letter to the Lords
of Plantation, dated August, 1683, in which he states that he arrived on “the 24th of
October last.” Ten days should have been added to this date to correct the error in computing
time by the Julian calendar, which was in vogue when Penn landed, and November 3
should have been considered the anniversary. Through an erroneous idea of the way in
which such changes should be calculated, eleven days were added, and November 4 was
fixed upon. The next year, however, the Society celebrated the 24th of October, and continued
to do so until 1836, the last year that we are able to trace the existence of the
organization.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Subsequent investigations have shown that Penn did not arrive before
Newcastle until October 27 (see Newcastle Court Records in Hazard’s <i>Annals of Pennsylvania</i>,
p. 596), and did not land until the following day.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> It is probable, therefore, that
Penn dated his arrival from the time he came in sight of land or passed the Capes of
Delaware. The first evidences we have of his being within the bounds of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
State of Pennsylvania are letters dated Upland, October 29, and this day, allowing ten
days for the change of time, bringing it to November 8, is the one that it is customary
to celebrate.</p>

<p>Nov. 8, 1851, Edward Armstrong delivered before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
at Chester, an able address, which contains nearly all that is known regarding the
landing of Penn. In it will be found the names of his fellow-passengers in the “Welcome;”
but a more extended list by the same writer is given in the Appendix to the 2d
ed., <i>Memoirs of Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. i. In 1852 an address was also
delivered on the same anniversary before the Historical Society by Robert T. Conrad.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Penn’s Treaty with the Indians.</span>&mdash;This was the subject of a report made to the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania by Peter S. Duponceau and J. Francis Fisher. It will
be found in <i>Memoirs of Historical Society</i>, vol. iii. part ii. p. 141. In it the opinion is
expressed that the treaty which tradition says Penn held with the Indians at Shackamaxon
was not one for the purchase of land, but was a treaty of amity and friendship, and was
held in November, 1682. This report has been followed by historians generally, and has
been accepted by nearly all the biographers of Penn. The subject, however, is one that
will bear further investigation. The writer of this chapter published in the <i>Pennsylvania
Magazine of History</i>, vi. 217, an article to show that the treaty which has attracted so
much attention was that described in Penn’s <i>Letter to the Free Society of Traders</i>, dated
August 16, 1683; that it was held on June 23 of that year; that not only “great promises
of friendship” passed between Penn and the Indians, but that land was purchased, the
records of which are in the Land Office at Harrisburg.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> In connection with this subject,
Mr. John F. Watson’s paper on the “Indian Treaty for Lands now the Site of Philadelphia”
(see <i>Memoirs of Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>, vol. iii. part ii. p. 129) should
be read, as well as “Memoir of the Locality of the Great Treaty between William Penn
and the Indians,” by Roberts Vaux (see Ibid., i. 79; 2d ed., p. 87). The proceedings of
the Historical Society upon the occasion of the presentation to it of a belt of wampum by
Granville John Penn, which is said to have been given to William Penn by the Indians
at the treaty at Shackamaxon,<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> will be found in <i>Memoirs of Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>,

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Immigrations.</span>&mdash;Independent of the Welsh and Germans, no large bodies of emigrants
came to Pennsylvania during the first decade of its existence, except from England and some
Quakers from Ireland. The prosperity of the new colony attracted settlers from other
parts of British America and the West Indies; but nearly all, judging from the religious
annals of the community, were either Quakers or in sympathy with them. In studying
the Welsh emigration, <i>John ap Thomas and his Friends: a Contribution to the Early
History of Merion, Pa.</i>, by James J. Levick, M.D., should be read; see <i>Pennsylvania
Magazine of History</i>, iv. 301. It is a history of the first company which came from
Wales, in 1682. The <i>History of Delaware County</i> by Dr. George Smith contains much
on the subject, with a map of the early settlements; cf. B. H. Smith’s <i>Atlas of Delaware
County, with a History of Land-Titles</i>, Philadelphia, 1880. The agreement entered into
between an emigration party from Wales and the captain of a vessel in 1697-1698 will be
found in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>, i. 330.</p>

<p>The German or Dutch emigration can be studied in <i>The Settlement of Germantown,
and the Causes which led to it</i>, by Samuel W. Pennypacker; see <i>Pennsylvania Magazine
of History</i>, iv. 1. It is a thorough examination of the question, showing how the emigrants
came from the neighborhood of Crefeld, a city of the Lower Rhine, near Holland.
The several publications we have mentioned printed in Dutch and German must also be
consulted.<i> William Penn’s Travels in Holland and Germany</i>, by Professor Oswald
Seidensticker, already mentioned (see <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>, ii. 237), shows
how naturally the event came about. Professor Seidensticker has also contributed “Pastorius
und die Grundung von Germantown” to the <i>Deutsche Pionier</i>, vol. iii. pp. 8, 56, 78,
and “Francis Daniel Pastorius” to the <i>Penn Monthly</i>, vol. iii. pp. 1, 51.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Special Subjects.</span>&mdash;There remain a few monographs worthy of mention.</p>

<p><i>History of Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations who once inhabited Pennsylvania
and the Neighboring States</i>, by the Rev. John Heckewelder, Philadelphia, 1819,
8º. This work was first published as vol. i. of the <i>Transactions of the Historical and
Literary Committee of the American Philosophical Society</i>. It was reprinted by the Historical
Society of Pennsylvania, with notes by the Rev. William C. Reichel, in 1876, and
forms vol. xii. of its <i>Memoirs</i>. Opinions regarding this work differ widely. It was
favorably reviewed by Nathan Hale in the <i>North American Review</i>, ix. 178, and severely
criticised by General Lewis Cass in the same publication, xxvi. 366. “A Vindication” of
the <i>History</i> by William Rawle will be found in the <i>Memoirs of the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania</i>, i. 258; 2d ed. p. 268. There is a portrait of Heckewelder in the American
Philosophical Society, and a copy of it in the Historical Society; see <i>Catalogue of Paintings,
etc., belonging to the Historical Society</i>, no. 85. As a further contribution to the
aboriginal history, we may mention <i>Notes respecting the Indians of Lancaster County,

vol. iv. part ii. p. 189. This treats largely of the Susquehannocks.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE ENGLISH IN MARYLAND, 1632-1691.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY WILLIAM T. BRANTLY,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Of the Maryland Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap06">MARYLAND was the first Proprietary colony established in America;
and its charter contained a more ample grant of power than was
bestowed upon any other English colony. To Maryland also belongs the
honor of having been the first government which proclaimed and practised
religious toleration. The charter was granted in 1632, by Charles I., to
Cecilius, second Lord Baltimore. But the true founder of Maryland was
George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, a man of singular merit, whose
influence upon the fortunes of the colony was such that his character and
career belong to its history.</p>

<p>George Calvert was descended from a Flemish family which had long been
settled in Yorkshire, where he was born in the year 1582. Graduating
Bachelor of Arts at Oxford, he travelled on the Continent, and then entered
public life under the patronage of Sir Robert Cecil. Calvert filled various
offices until Cecil became Lord High Treasurer, when he was appointed
clerk of the Privy Council. He was knighted in 1617, and, upon the disgrace
of Sir Thomas Lake, in February, 1619, he was appointed by James I.
one of the two principal secretaries of state. He was selected for this important
post because there was work to be done, and he had made himself
valued in public life for his industry and ability. It is true, indeed, that his
theory of the Constitution was similar to that held by the King. He had
always been allied with the Court as distinguished from the Country party,
and was a stanch supporter of the prerogatives of the Crown. In the Parliament
of 1621 he was the leader of the Government forces, and the immediate
representative of the King in the House of Commons. When he came
to draw the charter of Maryland he framed such a government as the Court,
during this period, conceived that England ought to be.</p>

<p>Calvert was not altogether friendly to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> It is a mistake to suppose
that his political fortunes were so bound up with the success of the
Spanish match, that, upon its final rupture in 1623, his position became untenable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
He did not resign his secretaryship until February, 1625; and
there is no sufficient reason for believing that he did not then do so voluntarily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pf400">See an account of this picture of the first Lord Baltimore, in the Critical Essay.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fuller, the chief contemporary authority, says that “he freely confessed
to the King that he was then become a Roman Catholic, so that he
must be wanting in his trust or violate his conscience in discharging his
office.” It is certain that he had not forfeited the favor of the King, nor incurred
the enmity of the all-powerful Buckingham. He was allowed to sell
his secretaryship to his successor for £6,000, and was retained in the Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
Council. A few weeks after his withdrawal from office he was created Baron
of Baltimore in the Irish peerage; and in 1627 Buckingham summoned him
to a special conference with Charles I. upon foreign affairs. The date of
his conversion to the Church of Rome has been the subject of much discussion,
but there is no satisfactory evidence that it preceded, for any length
of time, the open profession of his new faith.</p>

<p>From early manhood Sir George Calvert had been interested in schemes
of colonization. He was a member of the Virginia Company until its dissolution,
and was, as secretary of state, one of the committee of the Council
for Plantation Affairs. While secretary he determined to become himself the
founder of a colony, and in 1620 he purchased from Sir William Vaughan
the southeastern peninsula of Newfoundland. In the following year he sent
a body of settlers to this region, and expended a large amount of money in
establishing them at Ferryland. James I. granted him in 1623 a patent
constituting him the Proprietary of this portion of Newfoundland which
was called Avalon,&mdash;a patent which afterwards became the model of the
charter of Maryland. The fertility and advantages of Avalon had been
described to Lord Baltimore with the usual exaggeration of discoverers.
He made a short visit to it in the summer of 1627, and in the following
year he went there, accompanied by several members of his family, with the
intention of remaining permanently; but the severity and long duration of
the winter convinced him that the attempt to plant an agricultural colony on
that inhospitable shore was doomed to failure. In August, 1629, he wrote
to the King that he found himself obliged to abandon Avalon to fishermen,
and to seek for himself some warmer climate in the New World. He also
announced his determination to go with some forty persons to Virginia, and
expressed the hope that the King would grant him there a precinct of land,
with privileges similar to those he enjoyed in Newfoundland. Charles I., in
reply, advised him to desist from further attempts and to return to England,
where he would be sure to enjoy such respect as his former services merited,&mdash;“well
weighing,” added the King, “that men of your condition and breeding
are fitter for other employments than the framing of new plantations
which commonly have rugged and laborious beginnings.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer to his letter Lord Baltimore sailed for
Virginia, where he arrived in October, 1629. To the Virginians he was not
a welcome visitor. They either honestly objected to receiving Catholic
settlers, being proud of their conformity to the Church of England, or were
apprehensive that he had designs upon their territory. They tendered to
him and his followers the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. The latter
was one which no Catholic could conscientiously take, and it was therefore
refused by Baltimore. His offer to take a modified oath was rejected
by the council, and they requested him to leave the colony.</p>

<p>While in Virginia Lord Baltimore learned that the northern and southern
portions of the territory comprised within the old charter limits of the colony
had not been settled, and he determined to ask for an independent grant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
a part of this unsettled region. Upon his return to England he learned that
the King was willing to accede to his request. Baltimore finally selected
for his new colony the country
north of the Potomac, and prepared
a charter to be submitted
to the King, modelled upon the
Avalon patent. The name of
the colony was left to the choice
of the King, who desired that it
should be called Terra Mariæ&mdash;in
English, Maryland&mdash;in honor
of his Queen Henrietta Maria.
This name was accordingly inserted
in the patent; but before
it passed the seals Lord Baltimore
died. His death took
place April 15, 1632, and he
was buried beneath the chancel
of St. Dunstan’s Church. But
his great scheme did not die
with him. His rights were transmitted
to his son and heir Cecilius, second Lord Baltimore, to whom the
charter was finally issued, June 20, 1632.</p>

<p>The territory granted was defined with accuracy. The southern boundary
was the further bank of the Potomac, from its source to its mouth in
the Bay of Chesapeake, and ran thence to the promontory called Watkins
Point, and thence east to the ocean. The eastern boundary was the ocean
and Delaware Bay to the fortieth degree of latitude; and the northern boundary
was a right line, on the fortieth degree of latitude, to the meridian of
the fountain of the Potomac, where the southern boundary began. It will
be seen that Maryland, as originally defined, comprised all of the present
State of Delaware and a large part of what is now Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The country described in the charter was expressly erected into a Province
of the empire; and the Baron of Baltimore, his heirs and assigns, were
constituted the absolute lords and proprietaries of the soil. Their tenure
was the most liberal known to the law. They held the Province directly of
the kings of England, in free and common socage, by fealty only, yielding
therefor two Indian arrows, on the Tuesday of Easter week, to the King at
the Castle of Windsor. The Province was made a county palatine; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
Proprietary was invested with all the royal rights, privileges, and prerogatives
which had ever been enjoyed by any Bishop of Durham within his county
palatine. To the Proprietary was also given all the power that any captain-general
of an army ever had; and he was authorized to call out the whole
fighting population, to wage war against all enemies of the Province, to put
captives to death, and, in case of rebellion or sedition, to exercise martial
law in the most ample manner. He was empowered to establish courts and
appoint judges, and to pardon crimes. He had also the right to constitute
ports of entry and departure, to erect towns into boroughs and boroughs
into cities with suitable immunities, and to levy duties and tolls upon ships
and merchandise exported and imported. He could make grants of land
to be held directly of himself, and erect portions of the land granted into
manors with the right to hold courts baron and leet. It was further provided
that, lest in so remote a region all access to honors might seem to
be barred to men well born, the Proprietary might confer rewards upon
deserving provincials, and adorn them with any titles and dignities except
such as were then in use in England. All laws were to be made by the
Proprietary with the advice and assent of the freemen, who should be called
together, personally or by their deputies, for the framing of laws in the
manner chosen by the Proprietary. In the event of sudden accidents the
Proprietary might make ordinances for the government of the Province, provided
they should not deprive offenders of life, limb, or property. Freedom
of trade to all English ports was guaranteed.</p>

<p>Liberty to emigrate to the Province and there settle was given to all subjects
of the Crown, and all colonists and their children were to enjoy the
rights and liberties of native-born liegemen. There was an express covenant
on the part of the Crown that at no time should any tax or custom be
imposed upon the inhabitants or their property, or upon any merchandise
to be laden or unladen within the Province. The charter concluded by directing
that, in case any doubt should arise concerning the true sense of
any word or clause, that interpretation should always be made which would
be most beneficial to the Proprietary, “provided, always, that no interpretation
thereof be made whereby God’s holy and true Christian religion, or
the allegiance due to us, our heirs and successors, may in anywise suffer by
change, prejudice, or diminution.”</p>

<p>It is especially to be remarked that the charter contained no provision
requiring the provincial laws to be submitted to the Crown for approval.
Nothing was reserved to the Crown except the allegiance of the inhabitants
and the fifth part of all the gold and silver ore which might be found within
the limits of the Province. But the powers conferred on the Proprietary
were of a sovereign character; he was lord of the soil, the fountain of
honor, and the source of justice. These privileges were the work of a
friend of high prerogative; yet the rights of the people were not neglected.
The freemen of the Province were entitled to participate in the law-making
power, to enjoy freedom of trade, exemption from Crown taxation, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the rights and liberties of native-born Englishmen. All the laws of the
Province must be consonant with reason and not repugnant to the laws
of England. If it be true that the powers given to the Proprietary were
greater than those ever conferred on any other Proprietary, it is equally true
that the rights secured to the inhabitants were greater than an in any other
charter which had then been granted.</p>

<p>The charter expressly separated the Province from Virginia and made
it immediately dependent on the Crown. The entire territory of Maryland
had been included in the grants made in 1609, and subsequently to the
London company for the first colony of Virginia. This company became
obnoxious both to the Crown and the colonists, and, in 1624, a writ of
<i>quo warranto</i> was issued against its patents, the judgment upon which revoked
all the charters and restored to the Crown all the franchises formerly
granted. Virginia then became a royal colony, and there could be no question
of the right of the King to partition its territory at pleasure. But the
grant of Maryland nevertheless caused a great discontent in Virginia. Although
no permanent settlements had been made north of the Potomac, the
Virginians regarded all the territory comprised within the old charter limits
as still belonging to them, and objected to having it partitioned.</p>

<p>One member of the Virginia company had, indeed, established stations
for traffic with the Indians on Kent Island, almost in the centre of Maryland,
and on Palmer’s Island, at the mouth of the Susquehanna River.
This man was William Clayborne, destined to become famous in the early
history of the Province. He had been Secretary of the Virginia colony
and one of the Council. Before the visit of the first Lord Baltimore to
Jamestown, Clayborne had been commissioned to explore the great bay
and to trade with the Indians. He may then have set up trading stations
upon Kent and Palmer’s islands. In May, 1631, he obtained from Charles
I. a license authorizing him to trade for furs and other commodities in all
the coasts “in or near about those parts of America for which there is not
already a patent granted to others for sole trade.” This license, which was
merely passed under the privy signet of Scotland, could not be construed
as granting any title to the soil or government. In Baltimore’s charter
Maryland was described as hitherto unsettled,&mdash;<i>hactenus inculta</i>,&mdash;and
this unlucky phrase was afterwards the source of innumerable difficulties.
At the time of his visit to Virginia the region was probably unsettled so far
as he could learn.</p>

<p>When intelligence of the grant of Maryland reached Virginia the planters
were moved to sign a petition to the King, in which they remonstrated
against the grant of a portion of the lands of the colony which would cause
a “general disheartening” to them. The petition was referred to the Privy
Council, which, after hearing both parties, decided, in July, 1633, that Lord
Baltimore should be left to his patent and the Virginians to the course of
law; and that, in the mean time, the two colonies should “assist each other
on all occasions as becometh fellow-subjects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, from the outset, Lord Baltimore intended
that Maryland should be a place of refuge for the English Catholics, who
had as much reason as the Puritans to flee from persecution. The political
and religious hatred with which the mass of the English people regarded
the Church of Rome was increasing in bitterness, and the Parliament of
1625 had besought the King to enforce more strictly the penal statutes
against recusants. Soon after the grant of his charter Lord Baltimore
treated with the Provincial of the Society of Jesus, in England, for his assistance
in establishing a mission in the new colony. At the same time he
wrote to the General of the Order asking him to designate certain priests
to accompany the first emigration, whose duty it should be to confirm the
Catholics in their faith, convert the Protestant colonists, and propagate the
Roman faith among the savages. These requests were granted, and the first
expedition was accompanied by two Jesuits.</p>

<p>But Maryland was to be something more than a Catholic colony. Lord
Baltimore had already determined that it should be a “free soil for Christianity.”
When the charter was granted, it was well known that Baltimore
purposed to settle Maryland with Catholics. How came it to pass that,
under these circumstances, a Protestant king made a grant of such large
powers to a Catholic nobleman? Different views have been taken of the
clauses of the charter relating to religion. One view is that by the patent
the Church of England was established, and any other form of worship was
unlawful; another that the glory of Maryland toleration is due to the charter,
and under it no persecution of Christians was lawful; while a third view
is that the charter left the whole matter vague and undetermined, and therefore
within the control of the Proprietary and his colonists. The only references
to religion in the charter that need be considered are two: the
first, in the fourth section, giving the Proprietary the advowsons of all
churches which might happen to be built, together with the liberty of erecting
churches and causing the same to be consecrated according to the
ecclesiastical laws of England; the second, in the twenty-second section,
providing that no law should be made prejudicial to God’s holy and true
Christian religion.</p>

<p>These are the exact phrases used in the Avalon patent, which was issued
to Sir George Calvert while still a member of the Church of England. In
that case they probably operated as an establishment of that church. But
these phrases were not retained in the charter granted to a Roman Catholic
without good reason. The fourth section merely empowered the Proprietary
to dedicate the churches which might be built; it did not compel him
to build them: and the fact of being a Catholic did not then disable one
from presenting to Anglican churches. There is, moreover, nothing in this
section disabling the Proprietary from building churches of other faiths.
The proviso in the twenty-second section was conveniently vague. It cannot
be held either to establish the Church of England or to prohibit the
exercise of any other worship. No such construction was ever placed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
it by the Crown, or the Proprietary, or the people. It is certain that Baltimore
would not have accepted a charter requiring the establishment of a
church from which he and those whom he intended to be his colonists dissented.
It is still more certain that he would not have accepted a charter
prohibiting the exercise of the Catholic worship.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The most plausible view of these provisions is that they covered a secret
understanding between the Proprietary and the King, to the effect that both
Catholics and members of the Established Church should enjoy the same
religious rights in Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> The opinion entertained by some that the
charter itself enforced toleration is altogether untenable. These provisions
did not prevent the Church of England from being afterwards established
in Maryland nor avert disabilities from Catholics and Dissenters. Apart
from the supposed agreement between Baltimore and the King, any persecution
of Conformists in the Province would have been extremely impolitic;
it would have resulted in the speedy loss of the patent. But Baltimore
could without danger have prohibited the immigration of Puritans, and
could have discouraged in many ways the settlement even of Conformists.
Not only did he not do any of these things, but he invited Christians of
every name to settle in Maryland. It is the glory of Lord Baltimore and
of the Province that, from the first, perfect freedom of Christian worship
was guaranteed to all comers. Because the event proved that this magnanimity
was the truest wisdom and resulted in populating the Province,
there have not been wanting those who declare that it was not magnanimity
at all, but only enlightened self-interest.</p>

<p>By the decision of the Privy Council in July, 1633, upon the petition of
the Virginia planters, Lord Baltimore achieved his first victory in the long
struggle he was destined to wage
with the enemies of his colony.
Regarding his title to the territory
as unquestionable, he now
hastened his preparations for its
colonization. He had purposed
to lead the colonists in person,
but, finding it necessary to abandon
this intention, he confided the expedition to the care of his brother,
Leonard Calvert, whom he commissioned as Lieut.-General. Jerome Hawley
and Thomas Cornwallis were associated as councillors, and George
Calvert, another brother of the
Proprietary, was one of the emigrants.
Lord Baltimore provided two vessels,&mdash;the “Ark,” of about
three hundred and fifty tons burden, and the “Dove,” a pinnace of about
fifty tons. In October, 1633, the colonists,&mdash;“gentlemen adventurers
and their servants,”&mdash;to the number of about two hundred, embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
at Gravesend. The vessels stopped at the Isle of Wight, where Fathers
White and Altham (the Jesuits who had been designated for the service)
and some other emigrants were received on board. They finally set sail
from Cowes on the twenty-second day of November, 1633, and took the
old route by the Azores and West Indies.</p>

<p>Soon after their departure Lord Baltimore wrote to his own and his
father’s friend, the Earl of Strafford, that, after having overcome many difficulties,
he had sent a hopeful colony to Maryland with a fair expectation
of success. “There are two of my brothers gone,” he added, “with very
near twenty other gentlemen of very good fashion, and three hundred laboring
men well provided in all things.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>The vessels remained for some time at Barbadoes, and did not arrive at
Point Comfort until the 27th of February, 1634. Here the colonists were
received by Governor Harvey, of Virginia, “with much courtesy and humanity,”
in obedience to letters from the King. Fresh supplies having been
procured in Virginia, the “Ark” and “Dove” weighed anchor and sailed
up the bay to the mouth of the Potomac, which they entered and proceeded
up about fourteen leagues, to an island which they called St. Clement’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
The emigrants landed here, and took formal possession of Maryland “for
our Saviour, and for our Sovereign Lord the King of England.”</p>

<p>Governor Calvert left the “Ark” at the island and sailed up the river
with two pinnaces, in order to explore the country and conciliate the Indian
chieftains. He was accompanied by Captain Henry Fleet, of the Virginia
colony, who was versed in the Indian tongues and acquainted with the
country. They assured the chiefs that the strangers had not come to make
war upon them, but to impart the arts of civilization and show their subjects
the way to heaven. Not deeming it prudent to seat the first colony
so far in the interior, Calvert returned down the river and was conducted
by Captain Fleet up a tributary stream which flows into the Potomac, from
the north, a few miles above its mouth. This river, which is now called the
St. Mary’s, is a deep and wide stream. Six or seven miles above its mouth
the Governor’s exploring party came to an Indian village, situate on a bluff
on the left bank. They determined to settle here, but, instead of forcibly
dispossessing the feeble tribe in possession, they purchased thirty miles of
the land from them for axes, hatchets, and cloth, and established the colony
with their consent. And thus the method of William Penn was antedated
by half a century. By the terms of the agreement the Indians were to give
up at once one half of the town to the English and part of the growing
crops, and at the end of the harvest to leave the place altogether. The
“Ark” was sent for, and on the 27th of March, 1634, amid salvoes of artillery
from the ships, the emigrants disembarked and took possession of
their new home, which they called St. Mary’s.</p>

<p>Attention was first given to building a guardhouse and a general storehouse,
their intercourse meanwhile with the natives being of the most genial
character. The Indian women taught them how to use corn meal, and with
the Indian men they hunted deer and were initiated into the mysteries of
woodcraft. They planted the cleared land, and in the autumn of the same
year were able to send a cargo of corn to New England in exchange for salt
fish and other provisions. From Virginia the colonists procured swine and
cattle; and, within a few months after landing, the settlement was enjoying
a high degree of prosperity. The English race had now learned the art of
colonization.</p>

<p>Although Governor Harvey visited St. Mary’s and seems always to have
been friendly to the new colony, the Virginians were bitterly hostile. Captain
Young wrote to Sir Tobie Matthew from Jamestown, in July, 1634,
that it was there “accounted a crime almost as heinous as treason to favor,
nay, to speak well of, that colony” of Lord Baltimore. Sympathy with
what they regarded as Clayborne’s wrongs increased their enmity. Soon
after the “Ark” and “Dove” left Point Comfort, Clayborne informed the
Governor and Council of Virginia that Calvert had notified him that the
settlement upon Kent Island would henceforth be deemed a part of Maryland,
and requested the opinion of the Board as to his duty in the premises.
The Board expressed surprise at the question. and said that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
was no more reason for surrendering Kent Island than any other part of
the colony; and that, the validity of Lord Baltimore’s patent being yet
undetermined, they were bound to maintain the rights of their colony. It
was probably on account of remonstrances from Virginia that the committee
of the Privy Council for plantations wrote to the Virginians in July,
1634, that there was no intention to affect the interests which had been
settled when Virginia was under a corporation, and that for the present they
might enjoy their estates with the same freedom as before the recalling of
their patents. This letter, which was merely designed to show that Baltimore’s
charter should not invade any individual right, appears to have been
regarded by Clayborne as justifying his resistance to Calvert’s claim of
jurisdiction over his trading stations.</p>

<p>Clayborne endeavored at once to incite the Indians to acts of hostility
against the colony. He told them that the new-comers were Spaniards,
enemies of the English, and had come to rob them. These insinuations
caused a change in the demeanor of the Indians, which greatly alarmed the
people of St. Mary’s. The suspicions of the natives, however, were soon
dispelled and friendly relations with them were renewed. Clayborne now
resolved to wage an open war against the colony. Early in 1635 a <i>casus
belli</i> was found in the capture by the Maryland authorities of a pinnace belonging
to Clayborne, upon the ground that it was a Virginia vessel trading
in Maryland waters without a license. Clayborne thereupon placed an
armed vessel under the command of Lieutenant Warren, with orders to seize
any of the ships belonging to St. Mary’s. Governor Calvert determined to
show at once that this seditious opposition would not be tolerated. He
equipped two small vessels and sent them against Kent Island. A naval
engagement between the hostile forces took place in April, 1635, which
resulted in the killing of one of the Maryland crew, and of Lieutenant
Warren and two others of the Kent Island crew. Clayborne’s men then
surrendered and were carried to St. Mary’s. Clayborne himself took refuge
in Virginia, and Governor Calvert demanded his surrender. This demand
was not granted, and two years later Clayborne went to England. He presented
a petition to the King, complaining that Baltimore’s agents had
sought to dispossess him of his plantations, killing some of his men and
taking their boats. He offered to pay the King £100 per annum for the
two islands, and prayed for a confirmation of his license and an order directing
Lord Baltimore not to interfere with him.</p>

<p>This petition was referred to a committee of the Privy Council, before
which Clayborne appeared in person, and arguments upon both sides were
heard. The committee decided, in April, 1638, that Clayborne’s license to
trade, under the signet of Scotland, gave him no right or title to the Isle of
Kent, or to any other place within the limits of Baltimore’s patent, and did
not warrant any plantation, and that no trade with the Indians ought to be
allowed within Maryland without license from Lord Baltimore. As to the
wrongs complained of, the committee found no reason to remove them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
left both sides to the ordinary course of justice. Clayborne returned to
Virginia, postponing but not abandoning his vengeance, and Kent Island
was subjected to the government of St. Mary’s, Captain George Evelyn
being appointed commander of the isle. In the same year Palmer’s Island
was seized, and Clayborne’s property there confiscated.</p>

<p>In February, 1635, the first legislative assembly of the Province was
convened. Owing to the destruction of most of the early records during
Ingle’s Rebellion, no account of the proceedings of this Assembly has come
down to us. The charter required the assent of the Proprietary to the
laws, and when the acts of this Assembly were laid before Lord Baltimore
he disallowed them. In April, 1637, he sent over a new commission, constituting
Leonard Calvert the lieut.-general, admiral, and commander, and
also the chancellor and chief-justice of the Province. In certain cases, he
was directed to consult the council, which was composed of Jerome Hawley,
Thomas Cornwallis, and John Lewger. The governor was directed to
assemble the freemen of the Province, or their deputies, upon the 25th of
January ensuing, and signify the Proprietary’s dissent from the laws made at
the previous assembly, and at the same time to submit to them a body of
laws which he would himself send over. John Lewger, the new member
of the council, and secretary
of the Province, came to St.
Mary’s in November, 1637,
accompanied by his family
and several servants. He was distinguished as a scholar at Oxford, and
had been converted to Catholicism by the celebrated controversialist Chillingworth.
His appointment is an evidence of the solicitude shown by the
Proprietary for the affairs of his plantation. During the first years of the
settlement he and his friends expended above £40,000 in sending over colonists
and providing them with necessaries, of which sum at least £20,000
was out of Baltimore’s own purse.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-528.jpg" width="250" height="58" id="i528"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Proprietary contemplated the foundation
of an aristocratic State, with large tracts of land in the hands of individuals
who would be interested in upholding his authority. He published,
from time to time, certain “conditions of plantation,” stating the quantity of
land to which emigrants would be entitled. In the conditions issued in
1636 he directs that to every first adventurer, for every five men brought
into the Province in 1634, there should be granted two thousand acres of
land for the yearly rent of four hundred pounds of wheat; and to each
bringing a less number, one hundred acres for himself, and one hundred acres
for his wife and each servant, and fifty acres for every child, under the rent
of ten pounds of wheat for each fifty acres. The conditions offered to subsequent
adventurers were, naturally, less favorable. All these grants were
of fee-simple estates of inheritance, and the colonists received in addition
grants of small lots in the town of St. Mary’s. Each tract of a thousand
acres or more was erected into a manor, with the right to hold courts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
baron and leet, and the other privileges belonging to manors in England.
A large number of manors were laid off in the Province, and in some
instances courts baron and leet were held.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>It was only in this regard that the design of transplanting the institutions
of expiring feudalism to the New World was carried out. Political
and social equality resulted from the conditions of the environment. The
“freemen,” who were entitled to make laws, were early held to include all
but indented servants, whether they owned a freehold or not. The second
Assembly, which met in January, 1638, was a pure democracy. Writs of
summons had been issued to every freeman directing his personal attendance.
The governor presided as speaker, and the council sat as members.
Those freemen who did not choose to attend gave proxies. Proclamation
was made that all persons omitted in the writs should make their claim to a
voice in the Assembly, “whereupon claim was made by John Robinson,
carpenter, and was admitted.” Upon the question of the adoption of the
body of laws proposed by Lord Baltimore, the Speaker and Lewger (who
counted by proxies fourteen voices) were in the affirmative, and all the
rest of the Assembly, being thirty-seven voices, in the negative. Thus was
begun a constitutional struggle between the people and the Proprietary.
The latter held that, under the charter, the right of originating legislation
belonged exclusively to him. For this reason, he had rejected the laws
made in 1635, and had himself proposed a number of bills. The colonists
were unwilling to concede this claim, and now rejected, in turn, the propositions
of the Proprietary. This early evidence of the persistence with
which a handful of emigrants maintained what they conceived to be their
rights possesses a peculiar interest. The immediate result of the contest
was to leave the colony without any laws under which criminal jurisdiction
could be exercised. This subject next occupied the attention of the House.
Subsequently a number of laws were made, but with the exception of an
act of attainder against Clayborne, their titles only remain. They were
sent to Lord Baltimore, who promptly exercised his veto power upon them.
In February, 1638, a county court was held at which Thomas Smith, who
had been captured in the naval engagement described above, and subsequently
held a prisoner, was indicted by a grand jury for murder and piracy.
There being no court legally constituted to try Smith, he was arraigned and
tried before the Assembly, Secretary Lewger acting as the prosecuting attorney.
The House found him guilty, with but one dissenting voice, and he
was sentenced to be hanged.</p>

<p>Soon after Lord Baltimore had for the second time rejected the acts of
the Assembly, he wisely determined to yield his claim of the right to originate
legislation. Accordingly he wrote to his brother in August, 1638,
giving him power to assent to such laws as he might approve. The assent
of the governor was to give force to the laws till the dissent of the Proprietary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
should be signified. This double veto power was similar to that which
existed in most of the royal colonies, where the first negative was in the
governor and the second in the king. In a Palatinate government, like
Maryland, the Proprietary exercised the royal prerogative. There being no
further obstacle to legislation an Assembly was called to meet in February.
1639, which body was composed partly of delegates elected by the people,
and partly of freemen specially summoned by the governor’s writ. It was
also held that any freeman, who had not participated in the election of
deputies, might sit in his individual right. The laws passed at this session
provided principally for the administration of justice in criminal and civil
cases. It was enacted that the inhabitants should have all their rights and
liberties according to the Great Charter.</p>

<p>One of the acts declared that “Holy Church within this Province shall
have all her rights and liberties.” A similar law was made in the following
year. Both are founded upon the first clause of Magna Charta and must
be held to apply to the Roman Church, since the phrase “Holy Church”
was never used in speaking of the Church of England. But these acts can
hardly be regarded as evidence of an intention to establish the Roman
Church. They do not seem to have had any practical effect whatever. We
have seen that Lord Baltimore purposed to make all creeds equal in Maryland.
Apart from this fixed purpose, from which he never swerved, the
impolicy of granting any peculiar privileges to the Catholic Church, in a
province subject to England, was so apparent that it was recognized by the
Jesuits themselves. Among the Stonyhurst Manuscripts there is preserved
the form of an agreement between the Provincial of the Society of Jesus,
and Lord Baltimore, in which, after a statement of the manner in which
Maryland had been obtained and settled, it is recited that it is “evident that,
as affairs now are, those privileges, etc., usually granted to ecclesiastics of the
Roman Catholic Church by Catholic princes in their own countries, could
not possibly be granted here without grave offence to the King and State
of England (which offence may be called a hazard both to the Baron and
especially to the whole colony).” The agreement then binds the members
of the society in Maryland not to demand any such privileges except those
relating to corporal punishments.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>It is certain that, from the time the emigrants first landed at St. Mary’s,
religious toleration was the established custom of the Province. The
history of Maryland toleration does not begin with the famous Act of
1649. That was merely a legislative confirmation of the unwritten law.
Long before that enactment, at a time when intolerance and martyrdom
was almost the law of Christendom, and while the annals of the other
colonies of the New World were being stained with the record of crimes
committed in the name of religion, in Maryland the doctrine of religious
liberty was clearly proclaimed and practised. It is the imperishable glory
of Lord Baltimore and of the State. For the first time in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
the world there was a regularly constituted government under which all
Christians possessed equal rights. All churches were tolerated, none was
established. To this “land of the sanctuary” came the Puritans who were
whipped and imprisoned in Virginia, and the Prelatists who were persecuted
in New England. In 1638 one William Lewis was fined by the council
five hundred pounds of tobacco, and required to give security for his good
behavior, because he had abused Protestants and forbidden his servants to
read Protestant books. The Puritans were invited to settle in Maryland.
In 1643 Lord Baltimore wrote to Captain Gibbons of Boston, offering land
to any inhabitants of New England that would remove to his province, with
liberty in matter of religion, and all other privileges.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>It appears from a case that came before the Assembly in 1642 that there
was at that time no Protestant clergyman in Maryland. The only religious
guides were the Jesuit missionaries, and they formed the only Catholic mission
ever established in any of the English colonies in America. Two
priests, as we have seen, accompanied the first emigration. In 1636 the
mission numbered four priests and one coadjutor. They labored among
the Indians in the spirit of Xavier, establishing stations at points distant
from St. Mary’s. Their efforts to elevate the savage were not without success.
One of their converts was Tayac, the chief of the Piscataways. He
and his wife were baptized in 1640, when Governor Calvert and many of the
principal men of the colony were present at the ceremony. The Jesuits
also succeeded in converting many Protestants. The annual letter of
1638, as communicated to their Superior, states that nearly all the Protestants
who came from England in that year, and many others, had been
converted.</p>

<p>Although the missionaries did much towards conciliating the Indians,
and a fair and gentle treatment of them was the constant policy of the
colony, it was yet impossible to preserve a perfect peace with all the tribes.
The increase of the colonists began to alarm them, and they were constantly
committing petty depredations. All the inhabitants capable of
bearing arms were trained in military discipline, and a certain quantity of
arms and ammunition was required to be kept at each dwelling-house.
Expeditions were frequently made for the purpose of punishing particular
tribes which had committed “sundry insolencies and rapines.” Scarcely
anything is known of the details of these Indian wars. It was made a
penal offence for the colonists to supply any Indian with arms, but the
Swedes on the Delaware had no scruples in this respect.</p>

<p>In 1640 another Assembly was held. St. Mary’s County had now been
divided into hundreds, and conservators of the peace appointed for each
hundred. In addition to the burgesses elected in each hundred, the governor
summoned certain freemen by special writ, as had been previously
done. The theory upon which this Assembly and those held in the following
years proceeded, in framing laws, was that justice should be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
according to the law of England, except in so far as changed by provincial
enactments.</p>

<p>The Civil War was now at its height in England, and that mighty convulsion
filled all the colonies with alarm and uncertainty. The supremacy
of the Puritans foreboded danger to the colony of a Catholic nobleman,
who still adhered to the cause of the King. Governor Calvert determined
to consult his brother personally in regard to the course to be pursued in
this crisis. Delegating his powers to Giles Brent, he sailed for England
and soon after joined his brother at Oxford. They received from the King
a commission to seize any London ships that might come to St. Mary’s.
Baltimore sent this commission to Maryland; and in January, 1644, when
one Richard Ingle appeared in the Province with an armed ship from London,
Governor Brent seized the vessel, and issued a proclamation against
Ingle, charging him with treason to the King. Ingle was taken, but soon
after made his escape and returned to England. Governor Calvert arrived
in September, 1644, and found the Province torn with internal feuds and
harassed by Indian incursions. Many thought that the triumph of Parliament
would put an end to the Proprietary dominion. Clayborne availed
himself of the confusion to renew his designs upon Kent Island, and, by
the end of the year, he had regained his former possession. Ingle soon
after arrived in another ship, with parliamentary letters of marque. The
Proprietary was as powerless as the King with whose fortunes his own were
thought to be linked. Ingle landed his men, allied himself with the disaffected,
and easily took possession of the government. Governor Calvert
fled to Virginia, and the insurgents were undisturbed. The records of the
Province brand Ingle as a pirate. To plunder seems indeed to have been
his main purpose, and it is not clear that he even professed to act on behalf
of the Commonwealth. He afterwards alleged, in a petition to Parliament,
that, when he arrived in Maryland, he found that the governor had received
a commission from Oxford to seize all London ships, and to execute a
tyrannical power against Protestants; and that, therefore, he felt himself to
be conscientiously obliged to come to the help of the Protestants against
the Papists and Malignants. His only statement as to his proceedings in
the Province is that “it pleased God to enable him to take divers places
from them, and to make him a support to the well-affected.” It is, however,
certain that the period of Ingle’s usurpation was marked with much
oppression and extortion. The Jesuits were sent in chains to England,
and most of those deemed loyal to the Proprietary were deprived of their
property and banished.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1646 Governor Calvert, who had been watching
the progress of events from Virginia, deemed that the time was ripe for
a counter revolution. He appeared at St. Mary’s, at the head of a small
force levied in Virginia, and regained the government without resistance.
Ingle left the Province, and the body of the people returned to their
allegiance with marked alacrity. The most permanent evil caused by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
usurpation&mdash;commonly called Clayborne and Ingle’s Rebellion, although
they do not appear to have acted in concert&mdash;was the destruction of the
greater part of the then existing records. The entire period is, consequently,
involved in obscurity; and it is impossible to determine why it was
that so many of the inhabitants were ready to join Ingle in what they
afterwards called his “heinous rebellion.” Kent Island alone held out,
and Governor Calvert went there in person, and brought back the island
to subjection. The entire Province was now tranquillized; but Leonard
Calvert did not live to enter upon his labors. On the 9th of June, 1647,
he died at the little capital of St. Mary’s, which he had founded seventeen
years before, and where he had long exercised, with wisdom and
moderation, the highest executive and judicial functions. He had led out
the colony from England when a young man of twenty-six years, and
in the discharge of various offices he had, in the language of his commission,
displayed “such wisdom, fidelity, industry, and other virtues as rendered
him capable and worthy of the trust reposed in him.” Upon his
death-bed he named Thomas Greene his successor,
who now assumed the duties of governor.
Greene proclaimed a general pardon to
those in the Province who had “unfortunately run themselves into a rebellion,”
and a pardon to those who had fled the Province, “acknowledging
sorrow for his fault,” except “Richard Ingle, mariner.”<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>The cause of the monarchy was now prostrate in England, and in the
supremacy of Parliament Lord Baltimore saw great danger threatening his
colonial dominion. It was necessary to put it out of the power of his enemies
to say that Maryland was a Catholic colony, and at the same time he
felt bound to protect his co-religionists. He therefore determined to pursue
at once a policy of conciliation to the Puritans and of protection to the
Catholics. The course he adopted was one well calculated to attain this
double end. In August, 1648, he removed Greene, who was a Catholic,
and appointed William Stone governor. Stone was a Virginian, and well
known as a zealous Protestant and adherent of the Parliament. Lord Baltimore
at the same time issued a new commission of the Council of State
appointing five councillors, three of whom were Protestants, and he also
appointed a Protestant secretary. Accompanying the commissions were
oaths to be taken by the governor and councillors. Each was required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
to swear that he would not trouble or molest any person in the Province
professing to believe in Jesus Christ, “and in particular no Roman Catholick
for, or in respect of, his or her religion.” While the usual power to
assent to laws in the name of the Proprietary was given to Stone, his commission
contained a proviso that he should not assent to the <i>repeal</i> of any
law&mdash;already made or which should thereafter
be made&mdash;which might in any way
concern matters of religion, without special
warrant under the seal of the Proprietary. The object of this restriction
was to prevent the repeal, by subsequent legislatures, of the act of religious
toleration which Lord Baltimore purposed to have passed by the next
Assembly. By this act he did not design to have the custom of religious
liberty, which had prevailed from the settlement, at all enlarged, but only
to be a law of the land beyond the reach of alteration. This security
was the more necessary since Stone had agreed to procure five hundred
settlers to reside in Maryland, and these might create an overwhelming
Protestant majority.</p>

</div>

<p>The new governor and council entered upon their duties in the beginning
of 1649, and in April of that year the Assembly met. The first law
made was the famous “act concerning religion;” which, at least so far as it
related to toleration, was doubtless one of the sixteen proposed laws which
Lord Baltimore had sent over in the preceding year with the new commissions.
The memorable words of this act, the first law securing religious
liberty that ever passed a legally constituted legislature, provide that&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Whereas, the inforcing of the conscience in matters of religion hath frequently
fallen out to bee of dangerous consequence in those commonwealths where it hath
beene practised, and for the more quiet and peaceable government of this province,
and the better to preserve mutuall love and unity amongst the inhabitants here,” it was
enacted that no person “professing to believe in Jesus Christ shall, from henceforth,
be any waies troubled, molested, or discountenanced for, or in respect of, his or her
religion, nor in the free exercise thereof within this province, ... nor any way compelled
to the beleefe or exercise of any other religion, against his or her consent.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Assembly was composed of sixteen members, nine burgesses, the
governor, and six councillors. Their faith has been a matter of dispute, but
the most recent investigations make it certain that a majority were Catholics.
The governor, three of the council, and two of the burgesses were, without
doubt, Protestants. It is equally certain that three of the council and five
burgesses were Catholics. The faith of the remaining two members is
doubtful; and there is also doubt whether the governor and council sat as a
distinct upper house or not.</p>

<p>By the other sections of the “act of toleration,” blasphemy, and denying
the divinity of Christ, or the Trinity, were made punishable with death; and
those using reproachful words concerning the Virgin Mary or the Apostles,
or in matters of religion applying opprobrious epithets to persons, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
punishable by a fine, and in default of payment by imprisonment or whipping.
It does not appear that any of these penalties were ever inflicted.
The toleration established by this act
is so far in advance of all contemporary
legislation, that it would be invidious
to reproach the law-givers because
they were not still more enlightened.
It may have been that they regarded
any broader toleration as prohibited by
the provision of the charter respecting
the Christian religion, or as likely to excite
the animadversion of the Puritans
in England. Parliament had recently
passed a law (Act of 1648, chapter 114)
for the preventing of the growth of
heresy and blasphemy, by which the
“maintaining with obstinacy” of any one
of a number of enumerated heresies&mdash;such
as that Christ is not ascended into
heaven bodily, or that the bodies of men shall not rise again after they are
dead&mdash;was made a felony punishable with death.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc250">ENDORSEMENT OF THE TOLERATION ACT.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In 1649 Governor Stone invited a body of Puritans who were banished
from Virginia, on account of their refusal to conform to the Church of England,
to settle in Maryland. These Puritans, the fruits of a mission which
had been sent from New England to “convert the ungodly Virginians,” numbered
over one hundred. Stone having promised them liberty in the matter
of religion and the privileges of English subjects, they accepted the invitation,
and in this year settled at a place which they called Providence,&mdash;now
the site of Annapolis. The settlement was, at the next Assembly, erected
into a county, and named Anne Arundel, in honor of Lord Baltimore’s wife,
recently deceased, who was a daughter of the Earl of Arundel. The conditions
of plantation required every person taking up land in the Province
to subscribe an oath of fidelity to his lordship, acknowledging him to be
“the true and absolute lord and Proprietary of this province.” The Puritans
objected to this oath as being against their consciences, because it
required them to acknowledge an absolute power, and bound them to obey
a government which countenanced the Roman religion. It is clear that
these refugees from intolerance were eager to be intolerant themselves.
During a temporary absence of Stone in November, 1649, Greene, the
deputy-governor, foolishly proclaimed Charles II. king, and granted a
general pardon in furtherance of the common rejoicing. Although this
act was promptly disavowed, it afterwards became a formidable weapon
against Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their scruples, the Providence Puritans sent two burgesses
to the Assembly of 1650, one of whom was elected speaker of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
lower house. At this session there was first made a permanent division of
the Assembly into two houses, which lasted till the Revolution of 1776.
The lower house consisted of the burgesses, and the upper of the governor,
secretary, and council. The majority of this Assembly were Protestants;
but they made a law enacting, as “a memorial to all posterities” of their
thankfulness, fidelity, and obedience to the Proprietary, that, “being bound
thereunto by the laws both of God and man,” they acknowledged him “to
be the true and absolute lord and Proprietary of this province,” and declaring
that they would maintain his jurisdiction till “the last drop of our blood
be spent.” Another act was passed altering the oath of fidelity prescribed
by the conditions of plantation. The new oath afforded ample opportunity
for mental reservation. By it the subscribers bound themselves to maintain
“the just and lawful” right and dominion of the Proprietary, “not in
any wise understood to infringe or prejudice liberty of conscience in point
of religion.”</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore’s trimming at this crisis aroused the displeasure of Charles
II. Although a powerless exile, he deposed the Proprietary, and appointed
Sir William Davenant royal governor of Maryland, on the ground that
Baltimore “did visibly adhere to the rebels in England, and admitted all
kinds of sectaries and schismatics and ill affected persons into the plantation.”
Baltimore afterwards used this assertion to prove his fidelity to Parliament.
Sir William collected a force of French and sailed for Maryland, but was
captured in the channel.</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore was soon after threatened from a much more formidable
quarter. The revolt of the island of Barbadoes called the attention of Parliament
to the necessity of subjecting the colonies to its power, and by
an act passed Oct. 3, 1650, for reducing Barbadoes, Antigua, “and other
islands and places in America” to their due obedience, the Council of
State was authorized to send ships to any of the plantations, and to commission
officers “to enforce all such to obedience as do or shall stand
in opposition to Parliament.” When the news of this act reached Maryland,
the Puritans of Providence thought that the days of the Proprietary
dominion were numbered, and they consequently refused to send burgesses
to the Assembly which met in March, 1651. Upon information of their
conduct and of the perturbed state of the Province being transmitted to
Lord Baltimore, he sent in August, 1651, a long message to the governor
and Assembly. He declared that the reports concerning the dissolution of
his government were unfounded, and directed that in case any of the inhabitants
should persist in their refusal to send burgesses to the Assembly, they
should be proceeded against as rebels. He also requested the governor
and council to use their best endeavors to suppress such false rumors, and
suggested that a law be made punishing those spreading false news.</p>

<p>But they who asserted that the Proprietary dominion was about to fall,
did not “spread false news.” That steps were not immediately taken to execute
the Act of 1650 was probably owing to the fact that Scotland was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
in arms under the banner of Charles II. But after the “crowning mercy”
of the battle of Worcester, the Council of State, Sept. 20, 1651, appointed
two officers of the navy, and Richard Bennett and William Clayborne of
Virginia, commissioners under the act. They were directed to use their
“best endeavors to reduce all the plantations within the Bay of Chesapeake
to their due obedience to the Parliament and the Commonwealth of England.”
Maryland was at first expressly named in these instructions; but
before they were issued, Baltimore went before the committee of the Council
and showed that Governor Stone had always been well affected to Parliament;
proved by merchants, who traded to Maryland, that it was not in
opposition, and declared that when the friends of the Commonwealth had
been compelled to leave Virginia he had caused them to be well received in
his province. The name of Maryland was thereupon stricken out of the instructions;
but when they were finally issued, a term was used under which
the Province might be included.</p>

<p>Clayborne and Bennett were in Virginia; the other commissioners soon
after sailed with a fleet carrying a regiment of men, and one hundred and
fifty Scotch prisoners who were to be sold as servants in Virginia. A part
of the fleet finally reached Jamestown in March, 1652. The commissioners
speedily came to terms with Sir William Berkeley, and then turned their
attention to Maryland. They appeared at St. Mary’s toward the last of
March, and demanded submission in two particulars: first, that all writs and
proclamations should be issued in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties
of England, and not in that of the Proprietary; and second, that all the
inhabitants should subscribe the test, called “the engagement,” which was
an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The instructions of the commissioners
expressly authorized them to insist upon these terms. The governor and
council acceded to the second demand, but refused the first on the ground
that process in Maryland had never run in the name of the king, and that
it was not the intention of Parliament to deprive Lord Baltimore of his
rights in the Province. The commissioners immediately removed Stone
and appointed a council of six to govern the Province independently of the
Proprietary. Bennett and Clayborne then returned to Virginia, where they
appointed themselves respectively governor and secretary of that colony.
A few months later Stone, deeming that he could best subserve the interests
of the Proprietary by temporizing, submitted to the terms of the commissioners,
who, finding that Stone was too popular a man to be disregarded,
reinstated him in his office June 28, 1652.</p>

<p>Now that Virginia and Maryland were both under the authority of the
same commissioners, the Virginians thought that the time had arrived when
an attempt to regain their lost territory was likely to prosper. In August,
1652, a petition was presented to Parliament praying that Virginia might
have its ancient limits as granted by the charters of former kings, and that
Parliament would grant a new charter in opposition to those intrenching
upon these limits. This petition was referred to the committee of the navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
with directions to consider what patent was proper to be granted to Virginia.
The committee reported Dec. 31, 1652. They found that Kent Island had
been settled three years before the settlement of Maryland; that Clayborne
had been unlawfully dispossessed of it; that Baltimore had exacted
oaths of fealty to himself; that several laws of Maryland were repugnant to
the statutes of England, such as the one protecting Papists; that persons of
Dutch, French, and Italian descent enjoyed equal privileges with the English
in Maryland; and that in March, 1652, the governor and council of
Maryland had refused to issue writs in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties
of England. No action was taken upon this report. Baltimore had
previously presented a paper containing reasons of state why it would be
more advantageous for the Commonwealth to keep Maryland under a separate
government than to join it to Virginia. These reasons were adapted to
the existing condition of affairs, and are sufficiently ingenious.</p>

<p>The Province seems to have been quiet during the year 1653. In England,
Cromwell turned Parliament out of doors, and the whole strength of
the nation was devoted to the Dutch War. Lord Baltimore thought the time
propitious for an attempt to recover his colony. Accordingly, in the latter
part of the year, he directed Stone to cause all persons who had failed to sue
out patents for their land, or had not taken the amended oath of fidelity to
the Proprietary, to do so within three months upon pain of forfeiture of their
land. Stone was also directed to issue all writs and processes in the name
of the Proprietary. In pursuance of these instructions Stone issued a proclamation
in February, 1654, requiring those seated upon lands to obtain
patents, and swear allegiance to Lord Baltimore. A few weeks later he
commanded all officers of justice to issue their writs in the name of the
Proprietary, and showed that this change would not infringe their “engagement”
to the Commonwealth. In May he proclaimed Cromwell Lord
Protector. But the Puritans were not mollified by this act. Before the
proclamation of February had been issued, information as to Baltimore’s instructions
had reached the Puritans on the Severn and Patuxent; and they
had sent petitions to Bennett and Clayborne, in which they complained that
the oath of fidelity to be required of them was “a very real grievance, and
such an oppression as we are not able to bear,” and prayed for relief according
to the cause and power wherewith the commissioners were intrusted.
The open disaffection of the Puritans caused Stone in July, 1654, to issue a
proclamation in which he charged Bennett and Clayborne, and the whole
Puritan party, with leading the people into “faction, sedition, and rebellion
against the Lord Baltimore.” The commissioners, still acting under their
old authority, resolved again to reduce Maryland. They put themselves at
the head of the Providence party, and advanced against St. Mary’s. At the
same time a force levied in Virginia, threatened an invasion from the south.
Stone, deeming resistance hopeless, submitted. The commissioners deposed
him, and by an order dated Aug. 1, 1654, committed the government
of the Province to Captain Fuller and a Puritan council. An Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
was called to meet in the ensuing October for which Roman Catholics were
disabled from voting or being elected members. And thus the fugitives
from oppression proceeded to oppress those who had given them an asylum.
“Ingratitude to benefactors is the first of revolutionary virtues.” The new
Assembly met at the house of an adherent on the Patuxent River. Its first
act was one denying the right of Lord Baltimore to interfere in the affairs of
the Province. An act concerning religion was passed, declaring that none
who professed the Popish religion could be protected in the Province, “but
to be restrained from the exercise thereof.”</p>

<p>When the news of the deposition of his officers reached Lord Baltimore
he despatched a special messenger with letters to Stone, upbraiding him
for having yielded the Province without striking a blow, and directing him
to make every effort to re-establish the proprietary government. Stone,
thus commanded, resolved to dispute the possession of the government
with the Puritans. He armed the population of St. Mary’s, and caused the
records, which had been removed to the Patuxent, and a quantity of ammunition
to be seized. In March, 1655, he advanced against Providence with
about two hundred men and a small fleet of bay craft. He sent ahead of
him envoys with a demand for submission which was rejected. The Puritans
obtained the aid of Roger Heamans, master of the “Golden Lion,” an armed
merchantman lying in the port, and prepared for resistance. Stone landed
his men near the town on the evening of the 24th of March, and on the next
morning the hostile forces advanced against each other. The battle-cry of
the Puritans was, “In the name of God fall on!” that of their opponents,
“Hey for St. Mary’s!” The fight was short and decisive. The Puritans
were completely victorious. About fifty of Stone’s men were killed or
wounded, and nearly all the rest, including Stone himself, who was wounded,
were taken prisoners. The loss of the Puritans was trifling, but they did
not use their victory with moderation. A drum-head court-martial condemned
ten prisoners to death, upon four of whom the sentence was executed.
Among those thus tried and condemned was Governor Stone,
but the soldiers themselves refused to take his life. It is said that the intercessions
of the women caused the lives of the others to be spared. They
were however kept in confinement, and the estates of the “delinquents”
were confiscated.</p>

<p>Each party was now anxious to find favor in the sight of the Protector.
Lord Baltimore presented the affidavit of certain Protestants in the Province
as to the high-handed proceedings of the Puritans; while the commissioners
transmitted documents to prove that he was hostile to the Protector. In
the course of the year several pamphlets were published on either side of the
controversy. Cromwell, however, does not appear to have concerned himself
about the dispute, since both parties acknowledged his supremacy. In
January, 1655, Baltimore had obtained from him a letter to Bennett, directing
the latter to forbear disturbing the Proprietary or his people in Maryland.
Soon after the receipt of this letter Bennett abandoned the governorship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
of Virginia and went to England. He there made such representations
to the Protector, that, in September, 1655, Cromwell wrote to the “Commissioners
of Maryland,” explaining that his former letter related only to
the boundary disputes between Maryland and Virginia. After the battle
of Providence, Cromwell referred the matter to the Commissioners of the
Great Seal, and declared his pleasure that in the mean time the government
of Maryland should remain as settled by Clayborne. The Commissioners
of the Great Seal reported to the council of state in the following year.
This report was not acted upon, but was itself referred to the Commissioners
for Trade. It was probably favorable to Lord Baltimore, for he made another
effort to wrest his Province from the hands of the Puritans. In July,
1656, he appointed Josias Fendall governor of the Province, with all the
powers formerly exercised by Stone. Fendall was in reality only a persistent
and unscrupulous revolutionist,
but his activity had hitherto been exercised
on behalf of the Proprietary. Even
before his appointment his conduct had
excited the suspicions of the Puritan council. He was arrested by them on
the charge of “dangerousness to the public peace,” and kept in confinement
till September, 1656, when he was released upon taking an oath not to disturb
the existing government until the matter was determined in England.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 16th of September, 1656, the Commissioners of Trade reported
to the Lord Protector entirely in favor of Baltimore. The report was not
acted upon, and Bennett and Matthews, the agents of the Puritans, continued
the contest. In October they sent to the Protector a paper entitled, <i>Objections
against Lord Baltimore’s patent, and reasons why the government of
Maryland should not be put into his hands</i>. These objections merely recite
the old grievances. Baltimore did not wait for the report to be confirmed,
but, confident that his province would be restored to him, directed Fendall
to assume the administration of affairs. He also directed large grants of
land to be made to those who had been conspicuous for their fidelity to him,
and instructed the Council to make provision, out of his own rents, for the
widows of those who had lost their lives in his service. Towards the close
of the year the Proprietary sent his brother, Philip Calvert, to Maryland as
a member of the Council and secretary of the Province. Maryland was
now divided between the rival governments. The Puritans held undisputed
sway over Anne Arundel, Kent Island, and most of the settlements, while
Fendall’s authority seems to have been confined to St. Mary’s County. But
there were no acts of hostility between the opposing factions. In September,
1657, the Puritans held another Assembly at Patuxent, at which they
again passed an act in recognition of their own authority, and imposed taxes
for the payment of the public charges.</p>

<p>Such was the posture of affairs when an agreement was reached by Lord
Baltimore and the Puritan agents in England. The favor with which the
Protector regarded the old nobility, and his failure to notice the remonstrances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
which the Puritan agents had addressed to him, caused the latter
to despair of setting aside the adverse report of the Commissioners of
Trade. The new agent of Virginia, Digges, acted as the intermediary between
Baltimore and Bennett and Matthews, and the articles of agreement
were signed on the 30th of November, 1657. After reciting the controversies
and the “very sad, distracted, and unsettled condition” of the Province,
they provide for the submission of those in opposition to the Proprietary
and their surrender of the records and great seal. Lord Baltimore, on his
part, promised “upon his honor” that he would punish no offenders, but
would grant land to all having claims under the conditions of plantation,
and that any persons desiring to leave the Province should have liberty to
do so. The Puritans now desired the protection of the Toleration Act, and
Lord Baltimore therefore stipulated that he would never assent to its repeal.
Fendall, who had gone to England for the purpose of consulting the Proprietary,
immediately returned to Maryland with a copy of this agreement.
At the same time Bennett wrote to Captain Fuller, apprising him of the
engagement which had been made on behalf of his party. Fendall arrived
in the Province in February, 1658; and the Providence council were requested
to meet the officers of Lord Baltimore in order to treat for the
performance of the agreement. A meeting of the rival councillors accordingly
took place in March. The Puritans, fatigued by the long struggle,
were not unwilling to submit, but insisted upon making some changes in
the articles of surrender. Fendall accepted their terms, and the new agreement
was signed on the 24th of March, 1658. It was stipulated that the
oath of fidelity should not be pressed upon the people then resident in the
Province, but that, in its place, each person should subscribe an engagement
to submit to Lord Baltimore, according to his patent, and not to obey any
in opposition to him. It was further agreed that no persons should be disarmed;
that there should be a general indemnity for all acts done since
December, 1649, and that the proceedings of the Puritan assemblies and
courts, in cases relating to property rights, should not be annulled. Proclamation
was then made of this agreement and of the governor’s commission,
and writs were issued for an Assembly to be held in the ensuing April.
At this Assembly the articles of surrender were confirmed. And thus, after
six years of civil broils, the Proprietary sway was re-established.</p>

<p>But the spirit of that revolutionary epoch was not yet extinct in Maryland.
Another attempt to subvert the authority of Lord Baltimore was
made in the following year. This time the leader was Fendall himself, who,
after having broken faith with the Puritans, now broke faith with the Proprietary.
Upon the confusion which followed the death of Cromwell, Fendall
thought that the opportune moment had come for shaking off the rule
of his feudal lord. At a session of the Assembly held in March, 1660, the
burgesses, in pursuance of Fendall’s scheme, sent to the upper house a
message, in which they claimed to be a lawful assembly, without dependence
on any other power, and the highest court of judicature. “If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
objection can be made to the contrary,” the message concluded, “we desire
to hear it.” A conference between the houses was held, at which Fendall
stated that he was only commissioned to confirm laws till the Proprietary
should declare his dissent, but that in his opinion the true meaning of the
charter was that the laws made by the freemen and published by them in
his lordship’s name should at once be of full force. On the same day the
lower house came in a body to the upper, and declared that they would not
permit the latter to continue its sittings, but that its members might take
seats among them. Fendall then dissolved the upper house, and, surrendering
the powers he had received from the Proprietary, accepted a new
commission from the burgesses. Philip Calvert protested against the proceedings,
and left the house. The burgesses sought to fortify their authority
by making it a felony to disturb the government as established by
them.</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore made short work of these treacherous proceedings. As
soon as the tidings reached him, in the following June, he appointed Philip
Calvert governor. Soon after he obtained from Charles II. a letter commanding
all the inhabitants of the Province to submit to his authority.
Philip Calvert was sworn in at the Provincial Court held at Patuxent in
December, 1660, and had no difficulty in obtaining control of the Province.
No one ventured to disobey the commands of a monarch who had just been
restored to the throne amid universal enthusiasm. Fendall, indeed, attempted
to excite an insurrection, but, failing in this, surrendered himself
voluntarily. Lord Baltimore had instructed his deputy not to permit Fendall
to escape with his life; and subsequently, while proclaiming a general
amnesty, he excepted Hatch and “that perfidious and perjured fellow
Fendall, whom we lately entrusted to be our lieutenant of Maryland.”
Notwithstanding these instructions, Fendall was punished only by a fine
and disfranchisement.</p>

<p>Charles II. was duly proclaimed, and the power of King and Proprietary
permanently revived. The tranquillity which now came to the exhausted
colony was destined to last, without interruption, till the mighty wave of
another revolution in England proved fatal to the lord paramount of Maryland.
Clayborne, who has been called the evil genius of the Province, now
disappears from its history. His courage and energy have won the admiration
of some writers; but, according to the settled principles of public law,
his claim upon Kent Island was entirely without foundation. Towards the
close of 1661 Charles Calvert, the
eldest son of the Proprietary, was
appointed governor, and remained
in that office till the death of his
father. The history of the Province
becomes the record of peaceful progress under his wise and just
administration. The population, which in 1660 was 12,000, had increased,
five years later, to 16,000. In 1676 Lord Baltimore wrote to the Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
Council that the population was 20,000. The provincial assemblies continued
to be held at St. Mary’s, and new counties were from time to time
erected.</p>

<p>The cultivation of tobacco was, from the earliest period, the main occupation
of the colonists. Indeed, the prosperity of all the middle colonies
reposed chiefly upon this foundation. It was almost the sole export of
Maryland. There were no manufactures and no large towns in the Province.
It was an agricultural community, scattered along the shores of the
noble bay, and of the Potomac and other tributary streams which intersected
the country in every direction. The abundance of these natural
highways relieved the infant State from
a large part of the burden of maintaining
roads. Every large planter had at
his own door a boat-landing, where he
received his supplies, and from which
his tobacco was taken to be shipped
upon foreign-bound vessels. The high
price of tobacco in the second quarter
of the seventeenth century (ten times
its present value), and the large demand
for it by Dutch traders, led the
colonists to devote themselves so exclusively
to its cultivation, that, on
more than one occasion, they suffered
from a scarcity of food. Beginning in
1639, numerous acts were passed to enforce the planting of cereals. In
order to maintain the excellence of the tobacco exported, the Assembly
in 1640 enacted the first tobacco-inspection law,&mdash;and thus began a system
which has, in some form, been maintained down to the present day.
According to the Act of 1640, no tobacco could be exported till scaled
by a sworn viewer; and when a hogshead was found bad for the greater
part, it was to be burned.</p>

<p>Tobacco was not only the great staple of the Province, but also its chief
currency. Taxes were assessed, fines imposed, and salaries paid in tobacco.
After the Restoration the restrictive measures, to which we shall refer, and
the overproduction of tobacco caused great depreciation in the value of
the article. The consequent inconvenience was such that in 1661 the Assembly
prayed the Proprietary to establish a mint for the coining of money.
Lord Baltimore, by a doubtful stretch of his palatinate prerogatives, caused
a large quantity of shillings, sixpences, and groats to be coined for the Province.
These coins were put into circulation under an act, passed in 1662,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
requiring every freeman to take up ten shillings’ worth of them per poll for
every taxable person in his custody, and to pay for the same in tobacco at
the rate of two pence per pound. But their introduction did not give permanent
relief, and tobacco continued to be the chief medium of exchange.
Its value decreased so much, that, early in 1663, commissioners were appointed
by Virginia and Maryland to consider the evil and its remedy.
They could only suggest a diminution of the quantity raised. In the following
year the Virginia agents represented to the Privy Council the necessity
of lessening the cultivation of tobacco in Virginia and Maryland, and
offered proposals for effecting it. These proposals did not meet the approval
of Lord Baltimore. The Privy Council ordered that there should
be no cessation of the planting of tobacco; but, in order to encourage the
planters in cultivating other articles, directed that pitch, tar, and hemp, of
the production of those colonies, should be imported into England free of
duty for five years. In 1666 an agreement was made between delegates
from Virginia, Maryland, and Carolina, providing for a total cessation in
the planting of tobacco for one year. The legislatures of these colonies
passed acts to enforce this agreement; but the Maryland act was vetoed
by Lord Baltimore, upon the ground that it would work great injury to the
poorer sort of planters, as well as cause a loss of revenue to the Crown.
For various reasons these efforts to control the market by limiting the
supply never succeeded.</p>

<p>The colonists did not then fully perceive where the root of the evil lay.
There was not too much tobacco but too few buyers; and the number of
buyers had been artificially lessened. The real cause of this colonial distress
was the famous Navigation Act and the statutes which had been made
in pursuance of the policy then begun. The Navigation Act, passed by the
Long Parliament in October, 1651, provided that no goods should be imported
from Asia, Africa, or America but in English vessels, under the
penalty of the forfeiture of both goods and ship. Originally designed as
a blow at the commercial supremacy of the Dutch, this Act became, to use
the language of Burke, the corner-stone of the policy of England with regard
to the colonies. This Act was supplemented by still more restrictive
statutes passed in 1660 and in 1663 (15 Car. II. c. 7). The result of these
regulations was that the colonists could buy nothing except from English
merchants, and could sell nothing except to English merchants. They were
not even permitted to export their own goods in their own vessels. They
suffered from a triple monopoly of sale, of purchase, and of transportation.
They bought in the dearest and sold in the cheapest market.</p>

<p>The chief source of the revenue derived by the Proprietary from the
Province arose from the quit-rents which, from the earliest period, had been
charged on all grants of land. These rents were at first payable in wheat.
In later grants they were made payable in money or the commodities of
the country, at the option of the Proprietary, until 1671, when an export duty
of two shillings per hogshead was imposed on all tobacco, one half of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
went to the support of the government, and the other half was granted to
the Proprietary in consideration of his commuting his money quit-rents and
alienation fines for tobacco, at the rate of two pence per pound. After
1658 another source of Proprietary revenue was an alienation fine of one
year’s rent, which was made a condition precedent to the validity of every
conveyance. In 1661 there was given to the Proprietary a port and anchorage
duty of half a pound of powder and three pounds of shot on all foreign
vessels trading to the Province. The fines and forfeitures imposed in
courts of justice inured to the Proprietary as the fountain of justice and
standing <i>in loco regis</i>. The royal nature of the Proprietary dominion was
also shown in the use of his name in all writs and processes, as the name of
the king was used in England. Provincial laws were enacted in his name,
by and with the advice and consent of the upper and lower houses. Indictments,
including those upon the penal statutes of England, charged the
offences to be against his peace, good rule, and government.</p>

<p>The first mention of negro slaves occurs in an act passed in 1664; but
they had probably been previously introduced into the Province from Virginia,
where slavery existed before the settlement of Maryland. In 1671
an act was passed to encourage their importation, and slavery was thenceforth
established. It was long, however, before slaves took the place of indented
servants, who formed a large part of the population down to the
time of the Revolution. They at first consisted of those who had signed
an indenture of service for a limited number of years and were brought
into the Province by the masters themselves. Subsequently the traffic in
servants was taken up by shipowners and others, who sold them for the
remainder of their term to the highest bidders. The term of service, which
was at first five years, was reduced by the Act of 1638 to four years. Upon
the expiration of his indenture a servant was entitled to fifty acres of land
and a year’s supply of necessaries. These servants were called “Redemptioners,”
and many of them became valuable citizens. After the Restoration
the practice of kidnapping men in English seaports and selling them
as servants in the colonies became very common. Among the Maryland
papers is the petition of one Mrs. Beale to the king, complaining that the
master of a ship had taken her brother as his apprentice on a voyage to
Maryland, and there sold him as a servant. The lord mayor and aldermen
of London complained to the Council that “certain persons, called
spirits, do inveigle, and, by lewd subtilities, entice away” youth to be sold
as servants in the plantations. Owing to its equable climate, Maryland had
more of these indented servants than any other colony, and the statute book
contains many acts relating to them. The practice of sending convicts to
America, however, was warmly resisted, and in 1676 an act was passed to
prevent it.</p>

<p>A temporary exception to the universal religious toleration, which was a
capital principle of government in Maryland, occurred in the case of the
Quakers. The first Quaker missionaries appeared in Maryland in 1657.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
Two years later other preachers of that sect visited the Province and caused
“considerable convincement.” Their refusal to bear arms, or to subscribe
the engagement of fidelity, or to give testimony, or to serve as jurors, was
mistaken for sedition.</p>

</div></div>

<p>On July 23, 1659, under Fendall’s administration,
an order was passed directing that if “any of the vagabonds and idle persons
known by the name of Quakers” should again come into the Province,
the justices of the peace should arrest them and cause them to be whipped
from constable to constable out of the Province. There is no evidence that
this penalty was ever enforced. The most active Quaker missionary simply
received a sentence of banishment; and after the suppression of Fendall’s
rebellion there was no persecution of the Quakers. They found a refuge
in Maryland from the intolerance of New England and Virginia. In 1672<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
George Fox arrived in the Province and attended two “general meetings
for all Maryland Friends,” which he describes in his journal as having
been largely attended, not only by Quakers but by “other people, divers
of whom were of considerable quality in the world’s account.” Maryland
was also sought by many French, Bohemian, and Dutch families. In 1666
the first act of naturalization was passed admitting certain French and Bohemians
to the rights of citizenship, and from that time forward numerous
similar acts were passed.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1675, died Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, after
having inscribed his name upon one of the fairest pages in the history of
America. The magnificent heritage left him by his father was beset with
difficulties; but his courage, perseverance, and skill had triumphed over the
hostility of Virginia and the intrigues of Clayborne, over domestic insurrection
and Puritan hatred. The first ruler who established and maintained religious
toleration is entitled to enduring honor in the eyes of posterity. His
name is that of one of the most enlightened and magnanimous statesmen
who ever founded a commonwealth.</p>

<p>In the year following his death, Governor Charles Calvert, now the Lord
Proprietary, called an assembly at which a thorough revision of the laws of
the Province was made. Among the laws continued in force was the Toleration
Act of 1649. In the same year Lord Baltimore appointed Thomas
Notley deputy-governor, and then sailed for England, where he remained
three years. Upon his arrival he found that a clergyman of the Church of
England, named Yeo, residing in Maryland, had written to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, under the date of 25th May, 1676, begging him to solicit from
Lord Baltimore an established support for the Protestant ministry. “Here
are ten or twelve counties,” he writes, “and in them at least twenty thousand
souls, and but three Protestant ministers of the Church of England. The
priests are provided for, and the Quakers take care of those that are speakers,
but no care is taken to build up churches in the Protestant religion. The
Lord’s day is profaned. Religion is despised, and all notorious vices are
committed, so that it is become a Sodom of uncleanness and a pest-house
of iniquity.” There is reason to believe that this letter was an exaggerated
libel. At any rate the writer considered it easy to cure the evil. It
would be sufficient to impose an established church upon the Province. The
Archbishop referred the letter to the Bishop of London, who asked the
Privy Council to “prevail with Baltimore to settle a revenue for the ministry
in his province.” The Privy Council wrote to Baltimore communicating
the unfavorable information with regard to the dissolute life of the
inhabitants of his province, and desiring an account of the number of Established
and Dissenting ministers there. Lord Baltimore replied that in
every county of the Province there were a sufficient number of churches
which were supported by the voluntary contributions of those attending
them, and that there were, to his knowledge, four clergymen of the Church
of England in the Province. He also urged that at least three fourths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
the inhabitants were Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, and Quakers, the
members both of the Church of England and of the Church of Rome being
the fewest, “so that it will be a most difficult task to draw such persons to
consent unto a law which shall compel them to maintain ministers of a
contrary persuasion to themselves, they having already assurance by an
Act for Religion that they shall have all freedom in point of religion and
divine worship, and no penalties imposed upon them in that particular.”
The Council, however, directed that some provision should be made for
the ministry of the Church of England, and that the laws against vice
should be enforced. Baltimore returned to Maryland in 1680, but nothing
was done to carry out the orders of the Council.</p>

<p>Soon after his return the restless Fendall, in conjunction with John
Coode, attempted to stir up an insurrection of the Protestants against the
Proprietary. Baltimore, having early notice of the proceedings, arrested
Fendall. He was punished by fine and banishment, and the enterprise
ended almost as soon as it began. The great preponderance of the Protestant
population, and the course of affairs in England were fast making
the position of a Catholic Proprietary untenable. Complaints of the favor
shown to Catholics were constantly sent to England. In October, 1681, the
Privy Council wrote to Baltimore that impartiality must be shown in admitting
Catholics and Protestants to the council and in the distribution of arms.
In reply to these complaints a declaration was issued in May, 1682, signed
by twenty-five Protestants of the Church of England residing in the Province.
This declaration certified that places of honor, trust, and profit were
conferred on the most qualified, without any regard to the religion of the
participants, and that in point of fact most of the offices were filled with
Protestants, one half of the council, and by far the greater part of the justices
of the peace and militia officers, being Protestants. The subscribers
published to the world the general freedom and privilege which all the inhabitants
of the Province enjoyed in their lives, liberties, and estates, and in
the free and public exercise of their religion.</p>

<p>The first Proprietary had finally come off successful in the long contest
for his territory with Virginia and Clayborne. The second Proprietary was
now called upon to begin a longer and less successful struggle with William
Penn. The charter limits of Maryland included the present State of Delaware
and a large part of Pennsylvania. In 1638 a settlement of Swedes
was made on the Delaware, which was brought under subjection to the government
of the States General in 1655.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> In 1659 the governor and council,
in pursuance of Lord Baltimore’s instructions, ordered Colonel Utie to
“repair to the pretended governor of a people seated on the Delaware
Bay, within his lordship’s province, and to require them to depart the
province.” Utie had an interview with the authorities of New Amstel,
and threatened them with war in case of a refusal to leave. They replied
that the matter must be left to their principals in England and Holland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
Towards the close of the year the Dutch sent Augustine Hermann and
Resolved Waldron as ambassadors to Maryland. They had an interview
with the governor and council in which the claim of Holland to the territory
in question was formally presented. The governor asserted the title
of Lord Baltimore and demanded the submission of the settlements. This
demand was rejected and the interview terminated. The Dutch power in
America was soon after brought to an end by the Duke of York, to whom
Charles II. in 1664 granted all the territory between the Connecticut and
Delaware rivers.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> In 1680 Penn asked for a grant of the territory west of
the Delaware and north of Maryland. In his patent, which passed the
seals in March, 1681, the southern boundary of his province was a “circle
of twelve miles drawn around New Castle to the beginning of the forty
degrees of latitude,”&mdash;a description which it was impossible to gratify.
In April, 1681, the King wrote to Baltimore notifying him of Penn’s grant,
and directing him to aid Penn in seating himself, and to appoint some persons
to make a division between the provinces, in conjunction with Penn’s
agents.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> Lord Baltimore met Penn’s deputy, in September, 1682, at Upland
(now Chester), when it was found, by a precise observation, that the fortieth
degree of latitude was beyond Upland itself. The knowledge of this
fact caused Penn to be anxious to obtain a grant of Delaware. Though
the Duke of York’s grant did not extend south of the Delaware, Penn,
by dint of importunity, obtained from him in August, 1682, a grant of
the territory twelve miles around New Castle, and southward, along the
river, to Cape Henlopen. Penn asked for that which he knew to be within
the boundaries of Maryland, and beyond the power of the Duke to
grant. He also received a release of the Duke’s claim to the territory
of Pennsylvania, and soon afterwards sailed for his province.</p>

<p>On August 19, 1682, he had procured from the King a letter to Baltimore
directing the latter to hasten the adjustment of the boundaries.
An interview between the two Proprietaries took place in December, when
Penn handed to Lord Baltimore the King’s letter. Baltimore insisted upon
the fortieth degree as his northern boundary, and the conference was fruitless.
They had another interview, at New Castle, in the following year,
which also made it apparent that no agreement between the rival Proprietaries
was possible. Penn now raised against the Maryland charter an
objection similar to that which had been urged by Virginia and Clayborne,&mdash;that
Delaware had been settled by the Dutch before the grant of the
charter, and that, if this were not the case, Baltimore had forfeited his rights
by failure to extend his settlements there.</p>

<p>Both Penn and Lord Baltimore now resolved to go to England to contest
the matter before the King and Council. Baltimore called an assembly&mdash;the
last over which he presided in person&mdash;in April, 1684. He acquainted
them with the necessity he was under of going to England, and assured
them that his stay would be no longer than requisite for the decision of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
differences between Penn and himself. The Assembly then proceeded to
revise the laws of the Province; after which the Proprietary appointed a
council of nine, under the presidency of William Joseph, to govern the
Province during his absence, and sailed for England. Baltimore found
that he was no match in court influence for Penn. In November, 1685,
the Board of Trade decided that the Maryland charter included only
“lands uncultivated and inhabited by savages, and that the territory
along the Delaware had been settled by Christians antecedently to his
grant, and was therefore not included in it;” and they directed that the
peninsula between the two bays should be divided equally by a line drawn
from the latitude of Cape Henlopen to the fortieth degree, and that the
western portion was Baltimore’s and the eastern Penn’s. The Revolution,
however, came in time to prevent the execution of this decision, and the
vexed question was not finally settled till the middle of the following
century.</p>

<p>The accession of James II. brought increased danger to Lord Baltimore.
To a king who designed the subversion of the liberties of the colonies as
well as of England, the liberal charter of Maryland was especially odious.
In April, 1687, an order in Council was made directing the prosecution
of a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> against the Maryland charter. In that
age the issuing of such a writ seldom failed to achieve its object; but
before judgment could be obtained against Baltimore the Revolution of
1688 had occurred, and the Stuart dynasty was at an end. The tidings
that a writ had been issued against Baltimore’s charter alarmed the imaginations
of the provincials. When the Assembly met in November, 1688,
President Joseph sought to counteract this state of feeling in a manner
which only served to increase the anxiety. In his opening speech he
claimed his right to rule <i>jure divino</i>, tracing it from God to the King, from
the King to the Proprietary, and from the Proprietary to himself. He then
took the unprecedented step of demanding an oath of fidelity from the
Houses. The burgesses at first refused, and were with difficulty persuaded
to yield. The Assembly showed its loyalty to the monarch, who was then a
fugitive from his kingdom, by passing an act for a perpetual thanksgiving
for the birth of the prince, and fixed a commemoration of it each succeeding
tenth day of June.</p>

<p>Upon the accession of William and Mary the Privy Council directed
Lord Baltimore to cause their majesties to be proclaimed in Maryland. He
immediately despatched a messenger with orders to his council to proclaim
the king and queen with the usual ceremonies. This messenger unfortunately
died at Plymouth, and, although William and Mary had been acknowledged
in the other colonies, the Maryland council shrank from acting
without orders from the Proprietary, while they alarmed the inhabitants by
collecting arms and ammunition. Information of this delay was sent to the
Board of Trade from Virginia. Baltimore was consequently summoned before
it, when he explained that he had sent the required directions to Maryland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
but that they had failed to arrive. He was ordered to despatch
duplicate instructions, but before they reached the Province the Proprietary’s
power was overthrown. The absence of all colonial records from the
close of the session of 1688 to the year 1692 makes it difficult to understand
the exact cause of this revolution. Enough appears from other
sources, however, to show that it was a rebellion fostered by falsehood
and intimidation,&mdash;“a provincial Popish plot.” In April, 1689, John
Coode and other disaffected persons formed “An Association in arms
for the defence of the Protestant religion, and for asserting the right of
King William and Queen Mary to the Province of Maryland and all the
English dominions.” Early in July they began to gather in large numbers
on the Potomac. They alleged that the Catholics had invited the northern
Indians to join them in a general massacre of the Protestants in the following
month, and that they had taken arms to defeat this conspiracy. When
a similar rumor had been set on foot, in the preceding March, a declaration
had been published, signed by several of those who were now Associators,
asserting that the subscribers had examined into all the circumstances
of the pretended design, and “found it to be nothing but a sleveless fear
and imagination fomented by the artifice of some ill-minded persons.”
But in July the Association availed itself of this baseless rumor to obtain
the adherence of those who were foolish enough to believe it; while to
others they asserted that their purpose was only to proclaim William and
Mary.</p>

<p>By these means the neutrality or support of the greater part of the population
was secured, and the Associators moved upon St. Mary’s. The
council prepared for resistance, but, upon the approach of Coode with
greatly superior forces, they surrendered the State House and the provincial
records. The Association then published a “Declaration of the reasons
and motives for the present appearing in arms of their Majesties’ Protestant
subjects in the Province of Maryland.” This Declaration, dated July 25,
1689, signed by Coode and many others, was printed at St. Mary’s.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> It is an
ingenious and able paper, but certainly an audacious calumny, which could
only have found credence in England. It set forth that, by the contrivances
of Lord Baltimore and his officers, “the tyranny under which we groan is
palliated,” and “our grievances shrouded from the eye of observation and
the hand of redress.” These grievances were then stated in general terms.
In the mean time Joseph and his council retired to a fort on the Patuxent.
When Coode marched against them with several hundred men they were
again compelled to surrender, and the Associators became masters of the
situation. On the third of August, 1689, they sent an address to the king
and queen congratulating them upon having restored the laws and liberties
of England to their “ancient lustre, purity, and splendor,” and declaring
that, without the expense of a drop of blood, they had rescued the government
of Maryland from the hands of their enemies, and would hold it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
securely till a settlement thereof should be made. A convention was called
to meet on the 23d of August, to which however several counties refused to
send delegates. The convention sent an address to the King asking that
their rights and religion might be secured under a Protestant government.
The matter was now to be determined in England, and addresses from all
the counties and from both parties poured in to the King. Many Protestants
favored the Proprietary, and, in their addresses, denounced the falsehoods
of the Associators. A number of the Protestants of Kent County
declared in their address that “we have here enjoyed many halcyon days
under the immediate government of Charles, Lord Baron of Baltimore, and
his honorable father, ... by charter of your royal progenitors, wherein
our rights and freedoms are so interwoven with his Lordship’s prerogative
that we have always had the same liberties and privileges secured to
us as other of your Majesty’s subjects in the Kingdom of England.” The
greater number of signers, however, sided with the revolutionists. A
friend of Lord Baltimore wrote that “people in debt think it the bravest
time that ever was. No courts open nor no law proceedings, which they
pray may continue as long as they live.” The same writer asserted that
the best men and the best Protestants stood stiffly up for the Proprietary’s
interest.</p>

<p>Those who had benefited by a Protestant Revolution in England were
naturally disposed to look with favor upon a similar Revolution in America.
And thus it came to pass that the Proprietary government “fell
without a crime.”</p>

<p>King William on Feb. 1, 1690, in pursuance of the recommendation
of the committee of the Council for Trade and Plantations, wrote to those
in the administration of Maryland, acknowledging the receipt of their
addresses and approving their motives for taking up arms. He authorized
them to continue in the administration, and in the mean time to preserve
the public peace. Lord Baltimore struggled hard to retain his
province, although his chance of obtaining justice was desperate. He
presented to the King and Council various affidavits and narratives showing
the falsity of the charges against his government. In January, 1690,
he petitioned the Board of Trade to grant a hearing to such inhabitants
and merchants as had lived in and dealt with Maryland for upwards of
twenty-five years, at the same time forwarding a list of their names. A
few days later he requested the Board to hear his account of the disturbances,
to the end that the government might be restored to him. In
August, however, the Council directed the attorney-general to proceed by
<i>scire facias</i> against Baltimore’s charter. Chief-Justice Holt had previously
given an opinion that the King could appoint a governor of Maryland
whose authority would be legal; and the attorney-general and solicitor-general
were directed to draft a commission of governor.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March, 1691, Queen Mary wrote to the Grand Committee
of Maryland that the Province was taken under the King’s immediate superintendence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
that Copley would be governor, and, until his arrival, they were
to administer the government in the names of their Majesties. In the
following August Sir Lionel Copley was commissioned by the king and
queen. He reached Maryland early in 1692, and the Province became a
royal colony for a quarter of a century. The Proprietary was still allowed
to receive his quit-rents and export duty, but all his other prerogatives were
at an end.</p>

<h3><a name="c553" id="c553">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest publication relating to Maryland was a pamphlet which appeared in London
in 1634. It is entitled <i>A Relation of the Successful Beginnings of the Lord
Baltemore’s Plantation in Maryland: being an extract of certaine Letters written from
thence by some of the Adventurers to their friends in England</i>.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> The similarity of the
language of this relation with Father White’s <i>Relatio Itineris</i> would seem to show that he
was its author. The relation describes the first settlement and the products of the soil,
and narrates the naïve wonder of the Indians at the big ships and the thunder of the guns.
It is dated “From Saint Marie’s in Maryland, 27 May, 1634.”</p>

<p>The next publication was, <i>A Relation of Maryland</i>, London, Sept. 8, 1635,&mdash;a work
of great value to the student. It was evidently prepared under the direction of Lord Baltimore,
and is an extensive colonizing programme. It recounts the planting of the colony
and their intercourse with the Indians, and describes the commodities which the country
naturally afforded and those that might be procured by industry. It also contains the
“conditions propounded by the Lord Baltemore to such as shall goe or adventure into
Maryland,” and gives elaborate instructions as to what the adventurers should take with
them, together with an estimate of the cost of transporting servants and providing them
with necessaries.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>A very full account of the voyage of the “Ark and Dove” to Maryland is contained
in a letter written by Father Andrew White, S. J., to the General of the Order. The originals
of this letter, as well as of different letters from the Jesuit missionaries in Maryland
from 1635 to 1677, were discovered, about fifty years ago, by the Rev. W. M. Sherry, who
was afterwards Provincial of the Jesuits in Maryland, in the archives of the Society in
Rome. The copy he then made of these manuscripts is now in the possession of Loyola
College, Baltimore. In 1874 and 1877 the Maryland Historical Society published this
<i>Relatio Itineris</i>, and extracts from the annual letters, in the original Mediæval Latin, with
a translation by Mr. Josiah Holmes Converse. This publication also contains an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
the colony in which the character of the country and its numerous sources of wealth are
set forth in the glowing colors of anticipation. The original of this <i>Declaratio Coloniæ</i>
was also found at Rome. It was probably written by Lord Baltimore soon after the grant
of his patent, and sent to the General of the Society at the time of his request that priests
might be sent out to the colony. These publications are enriched with the notes of the
late Rev. E. A. Dalrymple, S. T. D.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> then Corresponding Secretary of the Maryland Historical
Society. The letters, which have been frequently used in the preceding narrative,
throw much light upon the early days of the Province, and give a vivid picture of the
activity of the missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p>The reduction of Maryland at the time of the Commonwealth caused several pamphlets
upon its affairs to be published in London. The first of these was <i>The Lord Baltemore’s
case concerning the Province of Maryland, adjoyning to Virginia in America with full
and clear answers to all material objections touching his Rights, jurisdiction, and Proceedings
there</i>, etc. London, 1653. This tract was probably called forth by the report of
the committee of the Navy on Maryland affairs in December, 1652. Although written by
Lord Baltimore, or under his direction, it is a temperate and reliable statement. It contains
his reasons of state why it would be more advantageous for the Commonwealth to
keep Maryland and Virginia separate.</p>

<p>An answer to this pamphlet was published in London in 1655, entitled, <i>Virginia and
Maryland, or The Lord Baltemore’s printed case uncased and answered</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> This work
is of value in giving a full statement of the Puritan side of the controversy down to 1655.
It has the proceedings in Parliament in 1652 relating to Maryland, copies of the instructions
of the commissioners for the reduction, and other documents.</p>

<p>There are four pamphlets bearing upon the battle of Providence in March, 1655. The
first is called, <i>An additional brief narrative of a late Bloody design against The Protestants
in Ann Arundel County and Severn in Maryland in the County of Virginia....
Set forth by Roger Heaman, Commander of the Ship Golden Lyon, an eye-witness there</i>.
London, July 24, 1655. The author gives a detailed but unfair account of the fight, and
of his connection with it, and of the previous proceedings of Governor Stone. Heamans
was answered by John Hammond, “a sufferer in these calamities,” in a tract, called <i>Hammond</i>
vs. <i>Heamans; Or, an answer to an audacious pamphlet published by an impudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
and ridiculous fellow named Roger Heamans</i>, etc. The author was the person despatched
by Stone, early in 1655, to remove the records from Patuxent. He declares that
he “went unarmed amongst these sons of Thunder, and myself alone seized and carried
away the records in defiance.” In the same year were published both <i>Babylon’s Fall in
Maryland</i>, etc., by Leonard Strong, and John Langford’s <i>Refutation of Babylon’s Fall</i>, etc.
Strong, the author of the former pamphlet, was one of the leading Puritans of Providence,
and afterwards their agent in London, where he wrote the tract. It is a party work, containing
a garbled statement of the facts. Langford’s <i>Refutation</i> has a letter from Governor
Stone’s wife to Lord Baltimore describing the conduct of the Puritans and their
treatment of her husband. Langford was rewarded for this work by Lord Baltimore with
a gift of fifteen hundred acres of land in Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>In 1656 John Hammond published his <i>Leah and Rachel; or, the Two fruitfull Sisters
Virginia and Maryland</i>. <i>Their present condition impartially stated and related</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>
This pamphlet is favorable to Lord Baltimore and condemns the Puritans.</p>

<p>A highly curious production is, <i>A Character of the Province of Maryland</i>, by
George Alsop. London, 1666.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Alsop had been an indented servant in Maryland, and
gives a favorable account of the condition of Maryland apprentices. The tract is written
in a jocular style, and was designed to encourage emigration to the Province. It contains
some interesting details concerning the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>Various causes, chief among which are Ingle’s Rebellion, time, and negligence, have
resulted in the destruction of a large part of the early records of the Province. The principal
portion of what now remains relating to the period before the Protestant Revolution
is contained in the following manuscript folio volumes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">1. Liber Z. The Proprietary Record-book from 1637-1642. This is the oldest record-book
extant. It contains a full account of the proceedings of the Assembly held in 1638, and of the
process against William Lewis for his violation of the proclamation prohibiting religious disputes.
This volume also has the records of the Council acting as a county court, and of proceedings in
testamentary causes. Many of the original signatures of Leonard Calvert, Secretary Lewger, and
others are scattered through the volume.</p>

<p>2. A. 1647-1651. The original second Record-book of the Province. The first fifty-eight pages
and several of the last are wanting. It has in it proceedings of assemblies, court records, appointments
to office, demands and surveys of land, wills, etc.</p>

<p>3. Y. 1649-1669. Journals and acts of different assemblies, commissions from the Proprietary,
etc. This volume contains the Toleration Act of 1649<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> and the proceedings of Fendall’s
revolutionary assembly in 1660.</p>

<p>4. H. H. 1656-1668. Council proceedings. The original volume containing instructions from
the Proprietary, commissions of Fendall and others, ordinances, and the proceedings against the
Quakers.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>5. A. M. 1669-1673. Council Proceedings. A copy probably made in the last century.</p>

<p>6. F. 1637-1642. Council Proceedings and other documents in vol. i. of the Land-Office
Records. This copy of the original, which is lost, was made in the first quarter of the eighteenth
century, and is certified by a Judge of the Provincial Court to be correct. This volume contains
Governor Leonard Calvert’s commission, Clayborne’s petition to the King, orders of the Privy
Council, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>


<p>7. A. 1647-1650. Council and Court Proceedings. Some part of the original is lost. A copy
in vol. ii. of the Land-Office Records.</p>

<p>8. B. 1648-1657. Council and Court Proceedings and Acts of Assembly. The original is lost.
A copy is in vols. i. and iii. of the Land-Office Records. This volume contains the proceedings of
Captain Fuller’s council and of the Puritan Assembly in 1654, lists of servants for whose importation
land was demanded, etc.</p>

<p>9. Vellum folio. 1636-1657. Council Proceedings. A copy made in the eighteenth century.
This volume has Stone’s commission, the conditions of plantation in 1648 and 1649, the proceedings
of Bennett and Clayborne in the reduction of Maryland, and of Stone and the Puritans. The
documents in this volume are not arranged in chronological order.</p>

<p>10. Vellum folio. 1637-1658. Proceedings of Assemblies. A copy.</p>

<p>11. F. F. 1659-1699. Upper House Journals. A copy. Contains a full account of the proceedings.</p>

<p>12. X. 1661-1663. Council-book. This original volume contains instructions from the Proprietary
to Philip Calvert and Fendall, demands and grants of land, etc.</p>

<p>13. 1676-1702. Votes and Proceedings of the Lower House. A copy made by the State Librarian
in 1838 from the original papers, which are not now to be found. It has the proceedings of
the Assemblies in 1676,1683, and 1684.</p>

<p>14. C. B. 1683-1684. The original Council-book for land.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The first five of the above volumes are in the possession of the Maryland Historical
Society, Baltimore, having been entrusted to its guardianship by a resolution of the Legislature
in 1847. The remaining folios are in the Land Office at Annapolis.</p>

<p>The three following manuscript volumes are in the office of the Clerk of the Court of
Appeals, at Annapolis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">15. Liber W. H. Laws: erroneously lettered on the back 1676-1678. This volume contains
laws made at different Assemblies from 1640 to 1688. They are not placed in strict chronological
order. These copies were made in the seventeenth century, and many of the transcripts are attested
by Philip Calvert as <i>Cancellarius</i>.</p>

<p>16. W. H. and L. 1640-1692. Laws made at some of the Assemblies held during these years.</p>

<p>17. C. and W. H. 1638-1678. Laws. A copy from older books made in 1726, and certified
to be correct.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The two following original volumes are in the State Library at Annapolis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">18. Proprietary, 1642-1644. Contains proceedings of the Council sitting as the Provincial
Court, proclamations, commissions, etc. A part of this volume has been transcribed into one of
the Land-Office Records.</p>

<p>19. Provincial Court of Maryland. Records. March, 1658-November, 1662. This volume
is in bad condition and several pages are wanting. It contains the records of the Council as a
Court, oaths of officers, depositions, etc.</p></div>

<p class="p1">A calendar of the state papers contained in Nos. 1-13 of the above volumes, and in
some of a later date, was compiled in 1860 by the Rev. Ethan Allen, under the direction of
J. H. Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> No systematic publication of extracts from these records has ever been
made. After the death of Mr. S. F. Streeter, in 1864, his large collection of manuscripts
pertaining to the provincial history of Maryland was placed in the hands of Henry Stockbridge
Esq., who prepared them for publication, and in 1876 some extracts from these with
notes by Mr. Stockbridge were published by the Maryland Historical Society in a volume
entitled, <i>Papers Relating to the Early History of Maryland</i>, by S. F. Streeter. This
volume contains the proceedings and acts of the Assembly of 1638, with a list of the members
and their occupations, the record of the case against William Lewis, the first will, the
first marriage license and various court proceedings.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Maryland at its January session, 1882, passed an act directing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
all the records and state papers belonging to the period prior to the Revolution be transferred
to the custody of the Maryland Historical Society, and appropriating the sum of two
thousand dollars to be expended by the Society in the publication of extracts from these
documents.</p>

<p>In 1694, when the capital was removed from St. Mary’s to Annapolis,&mdash;then called Anne
Arundel Town,&mdash;the Assembly directed that the records should be transported on horses,
and in bags sealed with the great seal and covered with hides. The persons charged with
this duty afterward reported to the Assembly that they had safely delivered the books to
the sheriff of Anne Arundel County. There is a full list of these volumes in the Journal of
the Lower House, and one perceives with regret that the greater part of them no longer
exist. Many state papers were greatly damaged during this removal, and others were lost
in the fire which destroyed the State House in 1704. When the government of the Province
was restored to Lord Baltimore in 1716, an act was passed appointing commissioners to inspect
the records and to employ clerks to transcribe and bind them. The preamble to the
act set forth the loss of several important records, and that a great part of what remained
was “much worn and damnified;” which was partly owing to the want of proper books at
first. On such general revisions of the laws as were made in 1676, 1692, and at other times,
it was customary to make transcripts in a “Book of Laws” only of those acts which were
continued in force. The record of the laws not re-enacted was then neglected.</p>

<p>Very little care was bestowed upon the state papers generally. Many of the volumes
cited by Bacon in his <i>Laws of Maryland</i>, published in 1765, are not now to be found. In
1836 the State librarian (Ridgely) made three reports to the governor and council upon the
early records, which contain a partial list of those then discovered. He says that in the
treasury department he found “the remains of two large sea-chests and one box which
had contained records and files of papers which were in a state of total ruin.” He also
discovered many early records, whose existence had not been suspected, in different public
offices, and some “under the stairway as you ascend the dome.”<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>Other original authorities for the history of the Province, second in importance only to
its own records, are the documents preserved in the state-paper office in London. The
peculiar nature of the palatinate proprietorship of Maryland, and the fact that the Proprietary
generally resided in England, have caused the Maryland papers to be more abundant
than those of any other colony. It was customary to send to the Proprietary documents
concerning all the public affairs of the Province. A large number of these, as well as
of the papers directly transmitted to the Privy Council or the Board of Trade, are in
the state-paper office.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> In 1852 Mr. George Peabody gave to the Maryland Historical
Society a manuscript index, prepared by Henry Stevens, to the Maryland papers, then
accessible in that office. This index contains abstracts of 1,729 documents relating to
Maryland affairs between the years 1626 and 1780; and the abstracts are somewhat more
full than those in Sainsbury’s <i>Calendars of State Papers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>Additional papers have been placed in the state-paper office since the Peabody Index
was made, and it is therefore necessary to consult both calendars. There are other manuscripts
relating to Maryland in the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and elsewhere
in England, of which no calendars have been published.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>A letter of Captain Thomas Yong to Sir Tobie Matthew, written from Virginia in July,
1634, describes his interviews with Clayborne and Captain Cornwallis, and passes an unfavorable
judgment upon the
former. Yong gives an account
of various plots of Clayborne
and other Virginians against the
colony at St. Mary’s, and of
Clayborne’s refusal to attend a
conference which had been arranged
for the adjustment of the
controversy. The letter is printed in <i>Documents connected with the history of South
Carolina</i>, edited by P. C. J. Weston, London, 1856, p. 29, and in 4 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i> ix.
p. 81 (Aspinwall Papers), and in the Appendix to Streeter’s <i>Papers Relating to the Early
History of Maryland</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">There are scarcely any remains of the buildings erected in the Province before 1688.
Lord Baltimore wrote to the Lords of the Committee for Trade and Plantations in 1678 that
“the principal place or town is called St. Mary’s where the General Assembly and provincial
court are kept, and whither all ships trading there do in the first place resort; but
it can hardly be called a town, it being in length by the water about five miles, and in
breadth upwards towards the land not above one mile,&mdash;in all which space, excepting only
my own house and buildings wherein the said courts and offices are kept, there are not
above thirty houses, and those at considerable distance from each other, and the buildings
(as in all other parts of the Province), very mean and little, and generally after the manner
of the meanest farm-houses in England. Other places we have none that are called or can
be called towns, the people there not affecting to build near each other, but so as to have
their houses near the water for convenience of trade, and their lands on each side of and
behind their houses, by which it happens that in most places there are not above fifty
houses in the space of thirty miles.”<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

<p>The principal building at St. Mary’s was the State House, erected in 1674, at a cost of
330,000 pounds of tobacco. In 1720 it was given to the parish of William and Mary to be
used as a church; and in 1830, being very much decayed, it was pulled down, and a new
edifice built in the neighborhood. Lord Baltimore’s house&mdash;called the Castle&mdash;stood on
the plain of St. Mary’s, at the head of St. John’s Creek. The spot is marked by a few
mouldering bricks and broken tiles, and a square pit overgrown with bushes.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> At St.
Inigoe’s manor, near St. Mary’s, there is preserved the original round table at which the
first council sat, besides a few other relics.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>The earliest historian of Maryland was George Chalmers, whose <i>Political Annals of
the present United Colonies</i> was published in London in 1780. Chalmers was a Maryland
lawyer, who returned to England at the outbreak of the Revolution. He had access to
the English state papers in writing his work, and his account of Maryland is fair and, for
the most part, accurate.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>The ablest man who has written upon the history of the Province was John V. L.
McMahon. He was born in Cumberland, Maryland, in 1800, and, after graduating at
Princeton, began the practice of the law in Maryland, where he soon became one of the
leaders of a very able bar. The first volume of his <i>Historical view of the Government
of Maryland from its Colonization to the Present Day</i> was published in 1831. Though
the author did not die till 1871, this volume was never followed by its promised successor.
The manuscript of the second volume is in the possession of McMahon’s heirs. The
volume published brings the history of the Province down to the Revolution, but its
strictly historical part is less than one half of the whole, and treats the subject only in
outline. The remainder of the book is devoted to an examination of the legal aspects of
the charter, the sources of Maryland law, and the distribution of legislative power under
the State government. The work is founded on an original study of the records, so far as
was thought necessary for its limited historical scope.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p><i>The History of Maryland from its first settlement in 1633 to the Restoration in 1660</i>,
in two volumes, by John Leeds Bozman, was published in 1837. The manuscript of this
work was offered to the State in 1834, after the death of its author, on condition of its
being printed within two years. The offer was accepted by the Legislature, and the book
was published under its direction. The first volume is introductory, and the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
Province proper is contained in the second volume. The work is based on an exact study
of the original records, and is a very careful and accurate summary in great detail. Bozman
did not have access to the papers preserved in the English state-paper office, and
much other material has been brought to light since he wrote. His strict pursuance of
the chronological order often results in sacrificing the interest of the narrative. The appendix
to the second volume has a valuable collection of extracts from the records. The
work as a whole may be said to furnish materials for the history of the Province rather
than to be the finished history itself.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p><i>The History of Maryland from its first Settlement, in 1634, to the year 1848</i>, in one
volume, by James McSherry, a lawyer of Frederick City, Maryland, was first published in
1849. It is written in an agreeable style, and, so far as relates to the period under consideration,
gives a clear summary of the leading occurrences, but does not appear to have
been founded on original investigation of the sources.</p>

<p>In Burnap’s <i>Life of Leonard Calvert</i>, published in Sparks’s <i>American Biography</i>,<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
there is an excellent history of the colony to the death of Governor Calvert in 1647. Dr.
Burnap was for many years pastor of the Unitarian Church in Baltimore. His chief authorities
were Bozman and Father White’s <i>Relatio Itineris</i>.</p>

<p>To Mr. George Lynn-Lachlan Davis, a member of the Baltimore Bar, who died a few
years ago, is due the credit of having settled the vexed question of the religious faith of
the legislators who passed the Toleration Act of 1649. His work was based on an examination
of wills, rent-rolls, and other records. His conclusions are those stated in the
preceding narrative. The result of his investigations was published in 1855 in a volume
entitled, <i>The Day Star of American Freedom: or, The Birth and Early Growth of Toleration
in the Province of Maryland</i>. It also contains a summary of all that is known of
the entire personal history of each member of the Assembly of 1649.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. E. D. Neill’s <i>Terra Mariæ: or, Threads of Maryland Colonial History</i>,
published in 1867, is a digressive account of the career of the first Lord Baltimore, with
some notices of men more or less connected with the Province in its early days. He
quotes many letters of the seventeenth century, but rarely refers to the source from which
he drew them.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> What the volume contains relative to the internal affairs of the Province
is not always accurate. Mr. Neill has published several pamphlets and articles on the
early history of Maryland, in which he endeavors to show that Maryland never was a Roman
Catholic colony, that a majority of the colonists were from the beginning Protestants,
and that the Church of England was established by the charter.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>The latest and most comprehensive <i>History of Maryland</i> is that by Mr. J. T. Scharf,
in three octavo volumes, published in 1879. This work extends from the earliest period to
the present day. Mr. Scharf publishes in full many valuable documents from the English
state-paper office, among which is an English translation of the charter of Avalon.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p>Histories of Kent, Cecil, and some other counties in the State have also been published.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The subject of religious toleration in Maryland&mdash;its causes and significance&mdash;has
given rise to much discussion both within and without the State. We shall refer only to
a few of the many pamphlets and articles which have appeared on this topic. In 1845 the
late John P. Kennedy delivered a discourse before the Maryland Historical Society on the
<i>Life and Character of the first Lord Baltimore</i>. He maintained that toleration was in
the charter and not in the Act of 1649, and that as much credit was due to the Protestant
prince who granted as to the Catholic nobleman who received the patent, and that the
settlement of the Province was mainly a commercial speculation. This discourse was reviewed
in 1846 by Mr. B. U. Campbell, who contended with so much show of reason that
the honor of the policy of toleration must be attributed to the Proprietary and the first
settlers, that Mr. Kennedy felt called upon in the same year to reply to the review.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> In
1855 the Rev. Ethan Allen published a pamphlet on <i>Maryland Toleration</i>, in which he
upheld Clayborne’s side of the controversy with Lord Baltimore, denied that Maryland
was a Catholic colony, and asserted that protection to all religions was guaranteed by the
charter. This question was also referred to in the discussion between Mr. Gladstone and
Cardinal Manning, concerning the Vatican decrees, in 1875. Cardinal Manning had
pointed to the toleration established by Catholics in Maryland to refute Mr. Gladstone’s
assertion that the Roman Church of this day would, if she could, use torture and force in
matters of religious belief. Mr. Gladstone replied, in his <i>Vaticanism</i>, that toleration in
Maryland was really defensive, and its purpose was to secure the free exercise of the
Catholic religion, because it was apprehended that the Puritans would flood the Province.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>Students of Maryland history are fortunate in possessing an admirable edition of the
laws of the Province, compiled in 1765 by Thomas Bacon, chaplain to the last Lord Baltimore.
It contains all the laws then in force, and the titles of all the acts passed in the
several assemblies from the settlement. There are references to the books where the different
acts are recorded, and numerous notes upon historical and legal points.</p>

<p>The chief impetus to the study of the history of Maryland and to the preservation of its
archives has been given by the Maryland Historical Society, which was organized in 1844.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
One of the originators of this Society was Mr. Brantz Mayer, an accomplished man of
letters, who until his death, two years ago, was active and efficient in promoting its welfare.
The Society has a large membership and occupies a suitable building in Baltimore. Its
library contains about 20,000 volumes, including nearly every book relating to the history
of Maryland. The collection of manuscripts bearing upon the Colonial and Revolutionary
history of the State is large and valuable. It has also many rare American maps, coins,
and pamphlets, and a large collection of Maryland newspapers from the year 1728. The
Society has published about eight volumes, relating chiefly to the history of Maryland.
It now has a permanent publication fund, which it also owes to the generosity of George
Peabody.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the loss of many original records, there is still in the State archives
an abundance of historical material which has never been adequately worked up by any
writer. This material is now better known and more accessible than formerly. Many
documents in the state-paper office are now being made known for the first time by the
calendars published under the direction of the Master of the Rolls. It is probable that
the papers in the British Museum and Bodleian Library will also be calendared. This
varied treasure of interesting and important material relating to the provincial history of
Maryland has never been thoroughly searched, and the history in which a satisfactory use
of it is made remains to be written.</p>

It will be understood that we now regard
it as satisfactorily settled that the voyage of discovery
took place in 1497, followed by a second
voyage in 1498.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I have spoken of the map of the discoveries
of the Cabots being made known to rival courts.
In a letter dated Dec. 18, 1497, written from
London by the Abbé Raimondo, envoy of the
Duke of Milan to the Court of Henry VII., recently
brought to light, and printed on page 54,
the writer, speaking of the return of John Cabot
from his voyage of discovery, says: “This Master
John has the description of the world in a
chart, and also in a solid globe, which he has
made, and he shows where he had landed.” Don
Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish Minister, also
writes to Ferdinand and Isabella, in the following
year, July 25, 1498, after the second expedition
had sailed: “I have seen the map which
the discoverer has made.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the year 1500, the Spanish navigator, Juan
de la Cosa, who had accompanied Columbus on
his second voyage to the West in the years 1493-96,
compiled a map of the world on which he
delineated all he knew of the Spanish and Portuguese
discoveries in the New World. He also
depicted, undoubtedly from English sources, the
northern portion of the east coast of the continent,
as is shown by a broad legend or inscription
running along the coast: “Mar descubierta
por Ingleses.” There was also placed at the
eastern cape of the coast: “Cavo de Ynglaterra.”
It is the earliest map known on which
the western discoveries are depicted. A few
copies of the map are supposed to have been
made soon after its compilation, one of which
hung up in the office of the Spanish Minister of
Marine. The map afterwards fell into neglect
and was forgotten. In the year 1832 it was
found and identified by Humboldt, in the library
of his friend the Baron Walckenaer, in Paris.
[It is on ox-hide, measuring five feet nine inches
by three feet two inches, drawn in colors, and
was afterwards bought in 1850 for 4,020 francs
(see Walckenaer <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 2,904) by the
Queen of Spain, and is now in the Royal Library
at Madrid. See Humboldt’s appendix to
Ghillany’s <i>Geschichte des Seefahrers Ritter Martin
Behaim</i>, and the appendix to Kunstmann’s <i>Entdeckung
Amerikas</i>; also Kohl’s <i>Discovery of
Maine</i>, 151, 179. This Cosa map is given in
part full-size and in part half-size, in Humboldt’s
<i>Examen Critique</i>, vol. v., 1839, but not accurately;
and again in connection with Humboldt’s
essay in Ghillany’s <i>Behaim</i>, Nürnberg, 1853.
This essay was also issued at Amsterdam in the
<i>Seeskabinet</i>, with the fac-simile of the map. The
only full-size fac-simile in colors is in three
sheets in Jomard’s <i>Monuments de la Géographie</i>,
pl. 16; and there are reductions of the American
portion in Stevens’s <i>Hist. and Geog. Notes</i>, 1869,
pl. 1 (following Jomard’s delineation); in De la
Sagra’s <i>Cuba</i>; in Lelewel’s <i>Géog. du Moyen Age</i>,
1852, no. 41. A biographical study of <i>Juan de la
Cosa</i>, by Enrique de Leguina, was published at
Madrid in 1877. Cosa died while accompanying
Ojedo in December, 1509. Peter Martyr, in 1514,
gave him a high rank as a cartographer. The
American (Asian) part of his map is given in
phototype herewith, reduced from Jomard’s fac-simile.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">Some have supposed that Cosa drew his
whole eastern coast of North America as a separate
and independent continent, entirely distinct
from Asia, on the authority of the maps of the
Cabots on which their discoveries were delineated.
Of course, in the absence of the maps or
globes of the Cabots, it is impossible for us to
tell precisely what was delineated upon them, or
how much of Cosa’s coast-line was copied from
them; but from whatever source this line was
drawn, it must be evident that it was supposed
by Cosa to be the eastern coast of Asia. Cosa,
so far as is observed from the fac-simile of his
map,&mdash;which is a map of the world,&mdash;drew no
east coast of Asia at all, unless this be it. (See
Stevens’s <i>Notes</i> as above, pp. 14, 17; Cf. Kohl,
pp. 145, 152, 153.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">I have already said that the discoveries of
the English on Cosa’s map were noted on the
northern portion of the east coast of the continent,
and if confined, as they appear to be, to
that region, we have no right to assert that the
remaining portion of the east coast-line was
supplied from the Cabots, but rather that it was
taken from well-known existing representations
of the east coast of Asia. The map and globe
of the Cabots, already referred to, had laid
down upon them the results of their experience
on their first voyage, the voyage of discovery, in
1497. Of the results of the voyage of 1498, with
which Sebastian Cabot is now more particularly
associated, we know but little. Accounts narrated
by others, but originally proceeding many
years after the event from Sebastian Cabot himself,
of a voyage to the new-found lands, have
been supposed by modern writers to refer more
particularly to this voyage; and these accounts,
as we shall see further on, speak of a run down
the coast to a considerable extent. That the
Cabots, or Sebastian Cabot, should have prepared
maps of the second voyage at the time of
its occurrence, as well as of the voyage of discovery,
is in every respect probable. But all
these early maps are lost. Perhaps they are yet
slumbering in some dusty archive.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[The Editor cannot derive from the reasons
expressed by Stevens (<i>Hist. and Geog. Notes</i>, p.
15) that the coast where the legend is put, represents
the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence;
for it is not easy to account for the
absence of the characteristics of a gulf, if “mar,”
unaccompanied by “oceanus,” signifies, as Stevens
holds, an enclosed sea; and if so, why is
the genuine gulf between Cuba and the Asian
coast called “mar oceanus”?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cosa’s map not having been engraved, or to any
extent copied, exercised but little influence on the
cartography of the period, and although the information
relating to the English discoveries
depicted upon it could have come from no other
source than the Cabots themselves, their names
were not inscribed upon the map; neither was
the legend already quoted copied upon any one
of the maps, relating to the new-found lands,
which soon followed. The enterprising Cortereals,
who are supposed to have seen Cabot’s or
Cosa’s map, soon spread their sails for the West,
and the maps of their discoveries, in the regions
visited by them, contained a record of their own
name, or inscriptions which have perpetuated
the memory of their exploits. (See vol. iv. of
the present work.) Not so with the Cabots
unless we should adopt the improbable statement
of Peter Martyr, in 1515, that Sebastian
Cabot gave the name <i>Baccalaos</i> to those
lands because of the multitude of big fishes
which he saw there, and to which the natives
gave that name. This subject is considered in
a later note.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another important map will be briefly referred
to here, as it may possibly have some
connection with the Cabots,&mdash;that of John
Ruysch, published in the Ptolemy of 1508, at
Rome. It is the first engraved map with the
discoveries of the New World delineated upon it.
[There are accounts of this map (which measures
twenty-one and a quarter by sixteen inches) in
Harrisse’s <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>,
p. 108; in the <i>Catalogue of the John Carter-Brown
Library</i>, i. p. 39; in Henry Stevens’s <i>Bibliotheca
Geographica</i>, No. 3058; and reproductions are
given in Humboldt’s <i>Examen Critique</i>, v., in his
essay on the earliest maps appended to Ghillany’s
<i>Martin Behaim</i>; in Stevens’s <i>Historical and
Geographical Notes</i>, pl. 2 (cf. <i>Historical Magazine</i>,
August, 1869, p. 107); in Santarem’s <i>Atlas
composè de mappemondes depuis le v<sup>e</sup> jusqu’au</i>
xvii<sup>e</sup>, <i>siècles</i>; in Lelewel’s <i>Moyen Age</i>; in Judge
Daly’s <i>Early History of Cartography</i>, p. 32 (much
reduced); and a section is given in Kohl’s <i>Discovery
of Maine</i>, p. 156. A copy of the original
is in the Sumner Collection in Harvard College
Library, and has been used for the fac-simile
herewith given.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] A northeastern coast
similar to that on the Cosa map is drawn, but
there is no record on it that the English had
visited it, and “Cabo de Portogesi” takes the
place of “Cavo de Ynglaterra,” on the point of
what is now called Cape Race. Concerning
John Ruysch, the maker of the map, who was
a German geographer, Kunstmann (<i>Die Entdeckung
Amerikas</i>, p. 137) says that he accompanied
some exploring expeditions undertaken
from England to the north. Marcus Beneventanus,
an Italian monk, who edited this edition of
Ptolemy, and included in it “A new Description
of the World, and the new Navigation of the
Ocean from Lisbon to India,” says: “But John
Ruysch of Germany, in my judgment a most
exact geographer, and a most painstaking one in
delineating the globe, to whose aid in this little
work I am indebted, has told me that he sailed
from the South of England, and penetrated as
far as the fifty-third degree of north latitude,
and on that parallel he sailed west toward the
shores of the East, bearing a little northward
(<i>per anglum noctis</i>), and observed many islands,
the description of which I have given below.”
Mr. Henry Stevens, from whom I have taken
this extract, thinks that Ruysch may have sailed
with the Cabots to the new-found islands. We
know that among the crew one was a Burgundian
and one a Genoese. Beneventanus professed
to know of the discoveries of the English as
well as of those of the Spaniards and Portuguese:
“Columbi et Lusitanorum atque Britannorum
quos Anglos nunc dicimus.” (Stevens’s
<i>Hist. and Geog. Notes</i>, p. 32; Biddle, p. 179.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">In his <i>Memoir of Sebastian Cabot</i>, p. 179, Mr.
Biddle calls attention to a remarkable inscription
on this map, placed far at the north, some
twenty degrees above “I. Baccalauras,” namely,
“Hic compassus navium non tenet nec naves
quæ ferrum tenent revertere valent” (“Here
the ship’s compass loses its property, and no
vessel with iron on board is able to get away”).
Mr. Biddle cites this inscription as showing the
terror which this phenomenon of the variation
of the magnetic needle, particularly noticed by
Cabot, had excited. (See Humboldt’s <i>Examen
Crit.</i> iii. 31, <i>et seq.</i>; Chytrœus, <i>Variorum in
Europa Itinerum Delicicæ</i>, published at Herborn,
in Nassau, 1594, pp. 791, 792.) Columbus had
noticed the declination of the magnetic needle
in his first voyage.</p>
<p class="pfc4">All these places in the new-found lands,&mdash;Terre
Neuve, Baccalaos, Labrador, etc.,&mdash;named
by European visitors to these shores, were supposed
to be sections and projections of the Old
World, and to belong to the map of Asia; and
this continued to be the opinion of navigators and
cartographers, advancing and receding in their
views, for a number of years afterward.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[Johannes Myritius in his <i>Opusculum Geographicum</i>,
published at Ingoldstadt in 1590, is accounted
one of the last to hold to this view.
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 314. After the discovery
by Balboa in 1513 of the South Sea, the
new cartographical knowledge took two&mdash;in the
main&mdash;distinct phases, both of which recognized
South America as an independent continental
region, sometimes joined and sometimes
disjoined from the northern continent; while in
one, North America remained a prolongation of
Asia, as in the map of Orontius Finæus, and in
the other it presented a barrier to western sailing
except by a northern circuit. An oceanic
passage, which seemed to make an island of
Baccalaos, or the Cabot region, nearly in its
right latitude and longitude, laid New England,
and much more, beneath the sea. The earliest
specimen of this notion we find in the Polish
Ptolemy of 1512, in what is known as the Stobnicza
map, one of the evidences that on the
Continent the belief did not prevail that the
Cabots had coursed south along a continental
shore. It was a year before Balboa discovered
the Pacific that this map was published at Cracow;
and we are forced to believe that divination,
or more credible report, had told John de Stobnicza
what was beyond the land which the Spaniards
were searching. The map is striking, and,
singular to say, it has not been long known.
The only copy known of the little book of less
than fifty leaves, which contains it, was printed
at Cracow without date as <i>Introductio in Ptholomei
Cosmographiam</i>, and is in the Imperial Library
at Vienna; and though there are other
copies known with dates (1512), they all lack
the maps, there being two sheets, one of the Old
World, the other of the New, including in this
latter designation the eastern shore of Asia,
which is omitted in the fac-simile given herewith.
A full-size fac-simile of the New World was
made by Muller of Amsterdam (five copies only
at twenty-five florins), and one is also given in
the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 53. We note
but a very few other copies, all however, except
one, without the map. One is in the great
library at Munich. A second (forty-three leaves
and dated 1512) was sold by Otto Harrassowitz,
a dealer of Leipsic, in 1873, to Muller of Amsterdam
(we suppose it to be the copy described
in the latter’s <i>Books on America</i>, iii. 163, which
was sold for 240 florins), from whom it passed
into the Carter-Brown Library in Providence.
Harrisse, <i>Bib. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 69, says there are
two copies at Vienna, one in the Imperial Library
(which has the map, a woodcut), and the
other in the City Library, both without date.
One or both of these copies are said to have
forty-two leaves,&mdash;Kunstmann, <i>Die Entdeckung
Amerikas</i>, p. 130. A fifth was advertised in
1876 by Harrassowitz, <i>Catalogue</i> no. 29, as containing
forty-six leaves, dated 1512, but without
the map, and priced at 500 marks. In the same
dealer’s <i>Catalogue</i> no. 61, book-number 56, a
copy of forty-six leaves is dated 1511, and priced
400 marks, which is perhaps the same copy
with a corrected description. See also Panzer,
<i>Annales Typographici</i>, vi. 454. From this it
would appear, as from slight changes said to
be in the text, that there were three separate
issues and perhaps editions about 1511-12. Mr.
Henry C. Murphy’s copy of 1513 has no map.
A second edition was printed in Cracow in 1519,
but without the map,&mdash;<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
no. 60; Harrisse, <i>Bib. Amer. Vet.</i> no. 95. The
Finæus map, above referred to, was a heart-shaped
projection of the earth, which appeared
in Grynæus’s <i>Novus Orbis</i>, in the edition of
Paris, 1532. A fac-simile of it has been published
by Muller, of Amsterdam, and in Stevens’s
<i>Notes</i>, pl. 4. America occupies the extreme edge
of the plate, and is greatly distorted by the
method of projecting. Mr. Brevoort reduced
the lines to Mercator’s projection for Stevens’s
<i>Historical and Geographical Notes</i>, 1869, pl. 3;
and a fac-simile of this reduction, which shows
also the true Asian coast-line in its right longitude,
and curiously resembling the American
(Asian) coast of the map, is given herewith. See
also Stevens’s <i>Bibliotheca Geographica</i>, p. 124;
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 104; Harrisse, <i>Bibliographia
Americana vet.</i> pp. 294, 297. There are
copies of the map also found in the 1540 editions
of Pomponius Mela, and in the <i>Geografia</i> of Lafreri
and others, published at Rome, 1554-72.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<i>Baccalaos</i> is an old ante-columbian name
for codfish, in extensive use in the South of
Europe. Humboldt says (Ghillany, p. 4), “Stockfischland,
von Bacallao, dem Spanischen Namen
des stockfisches.” Mr. Brevoort says it is the
Iberian name for codfish; see his <i>Verrazano the
Navigator</i>, pp. 61, 137, where the etymology of
the word is given. The name is found on many
of the early charts. On that of Reynel, the Portuguese
pilot, assigned by geographers to the year
1504 or 1505, it appears on the east coast as
“Y dos Bocalhas” (Island of Codfish). On the
chart of Ruysch, 1508, it is seen as applied to a
small island, or cape, as “J. Baccalaurus.” On
another Portuguese map published by Kunstmann,
assigned to the year 1514, or a little later,
the name “Bacalnaos” is applied to Newfoundland
and Labrador, including also Nova Scotia.
After various fortunes the name became subject
to the limitations which overtook “Norumbega,”
and has settled down on a small island on the
east coast of Newfoundland. There appears to
be no evidence, except Martyr’s statement, that
Cabot gave the name to the region he discovered;
and it may well be asked on what book or map
he had caused it to be inscribed? There is no
such name on Cosa’s map, the only early record
of the Cabots’ discoveries in the New World.
The name was probably applied by the Portuguese.
Dr. John G. Kohl, the distinguished
geographer, says that the Portuguese originated
the name of Tierra de Bacalhas (“the stock-fish
country”) and gave currency to it, though the
word, like the cod-fishery itself, appears to be
of Germanic origin. See his learned note in
full in <i>Doc. Hist. of Maine</i>, i. 188, 189, and compare
Parkman’s <i>Pioneers of France</i>, pp. 170, 171.
Parkman says: “If, in the original Basque,
<i>baccalaos</i> is the word for codfish, and if Cabot
found it in use among the inhabitants of Newfoundland,
it is hard to escape the conclusion
that Basques had been there before him.” The
affirmative of this proposition&mdash;that the Cabots
had been preceded by the fishermen&mdash;has been
held by a few writers, but it is generally believed
that the evidence for it is insufficient.
Dr. Kohl says: “That the name should have
been introduced by the Cabots is for many
reasons most improbable; and that they should
have heard and received the name from the Indians,
is certainly not true; though both these
facts are asserted by Peter Martyr, <i>De Orbe
Novo</i>, dec. iii. ch. 6.” (Kohl, pp. 188, 189;
and compare his statement on p. 481.) Dr.
Kohl had already said that the name, with
some transposition  of the letters, had long been
used, before the discoveries of the Cabots and
Cortereals, in many Flemish and German books
and documents. It should be added that the
statement of Peter Martyr, that the savages on
the coast visited by Sebastian Cabot called a
certain kind of fish found there in abundance
<i>baccalaos</i>, is repeated in the legend on Cabot’s
map, published in 1544, as rendered by Hakluyt
in his folio of 1589, p. 511. Indeed, much
in the general description of the coast and the
inhabitants, both of the sea and the land, is
similar in both accounts, and indicates one
origin.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[In a dispute with England so early as 1672,
the Spaniards claimed a right to fish at Newfoundland
by reason of the prior discovery by
the Biscayan fishermen. <i>Papers relating to the
rupture with Spain</i>, London, 1672. The latest
claim for the Basques’ antedating Cabot in this
region is in C. L. Woodbury’s <i>Relation of the
Fisheries to the Discovery of North America</i>, Boston,
1880.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

This, the earliest notice of Cabot which I
have seen in print, and, written by one so
distinguished as Peter Martyr, who had such
rare opportunities for information, is given
almost entire. It is from the quaint English
version of Richard Eden, made some three hundred
and thirty years ago, and published in his
<i>Decades</i>, fol. 118, 119. The translation has been
compared with the Latin text of Martyr, in the
<i>De Orbe Novo</i> of 1516, “Tertie decadis liber
sextus,” printed the year after it was written,
and a few redundances eliminated. See M.
D’Avezac’s criticism on some of Eden’s English
renderings, in <i>Revue Critique</i>, v. 265.</p>

When Mr. Biddle was issuing the second
London edition of his <i>Memoir of Sebastian Cabot</i>,
in 1832, he cancelled one leaf in the book, at
pages 77, 78, that he might insert a notice of an
early dramatic poem cited by J. Payne Collier in
his then recently published <i>History of English
Dramatic Poetry ... and Annals of the Stage</i>,
London, 1831, ii. 319. The play was entitled,
<i>A new interlude and a mery of the nature of
the iiij elements declaryinge many proper poynts
of phylosophy naturall and of dyvers straunge
landys and of dyvers straunge effects and causis</i>,
etc. Dr. Dibdin, in his <i>Typogr. Ant.</i>, iii. 105,
inserts it among the works from Rastell’s press,
and in a manuscript note at the beginning of the
copy in the British Museum, it is said to have
been printed by him in 1519. This copy, the
only one known, formerly belonged to Garrick.
I saw it in London in 1866, and collated it with
the brief extracts in Collier. It is imperfect;
and, as the colophon is wanting, the imprint, including
date, is gone. Different years have been
assigned to the book according as the reader
has interpreted the historical references in it.
The citations from the “Interlude” which follow
are taken from the publications of the
Percy Society, vol. xxii. issued in 1848. Among
the characters is one <i>Experyens</i> (Experience),
who represents a practical navigator who had
been a great traveller:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfc4">The date ascribed to the play by the writer
of the memorandum in it, 1519, would seem to
be not far from the truth. But the verses which
speak of the discovery made for the late king,
Henry VII., principally interest us here. They
would seem to refer to the Cabots, who made
the only authentic Western discovery for England
in that reign. The whole poem has been reprinted
by the Percy Society. See Winsor’s
<i>Halliwelliana</i>, p. 8, and references there. Mr. J.
F. Nicholls, in his <i>Life of Sebastian Cabot</i>, London,
1869, p. 91, prints these lines, and thinks
“that the Experyens herein depicted was none
other than Sebastian Cabot himself.”</p>

I might mention here an interesting map
composed by the English merchant, Robert
Thorne, while residing in Seville in Spain, in
1527, and sent, with a long discourse on cosmography,
to Dr. Ley, English ambassador to
Charles V. The map is very rude, and was first
published with the discourse by Hakluyt in his
little quarto in 1582. Along the line of the coast
of Labrador is a Latin inscription of which the
following is the English reading: “This land was
first discovered by the English.” Thorne was
very urgent&mdash;as well in his letter to Dr. Ley as
in a letter to the king, Henry VIII., also published
by Hakluyt&mdash;that the English should engage
in those maritime discoveries to the west
which the Spaniards and the Portuguese were
monopolizing.</p>

In Ziegler’s original work he begins this
sentence thus: “Petrus Martyr mediolanensis
in hispanicis navigationibus scribit, <i>Antoninum
quendam Cabotum</i> solventem a Britannia,” etc.
This clerical or typographical error as to Cabot’s
Christian name probably arose from a misreading
of Martyr’s language in Dec. iii. lib. 6: “Scrutatus
est eas <i>Sebastianus quidam Cabotus</i>.” Eden
did not hesitate to substitute Sebastian for Anthony.
As a mystification concerning the name
Antoninum (or Anthony) Cabot, I will add that
Mr. Brevoort has called my attention to the following
entry in <i>Letters and Papers, Foreign and
Domestic, Henry VIII.</i>, vol. i. pt. 1, p. 939,
doc. 5639, Nov. 27, 1514: “Patent denization to
<i>Anthony Chabo</i>, surgeon, native of Savoy,” with
another entry showing that in 1512 an annuity
of twenty pounds was granted to him; and Mr.
Brevoort asks the question if Anthony could
have been another son of Jean Cabot, arriving
in England later; and also whether the Cabots
might not have come originally from Savoy?

Ægyptus, Schondia, Holmia</i>,&mdash;the section on

Ziegler’s book is rare and curious; he
was a geographer of great repute. Such books
often serve to perpetuate references to more
important works, and to show the erroneous geographical
opinions of the period. A second edition,
under a different title, was published at the
same place in 1536. See Harrisse’s <i>Biblio.

In a recent letter from Mr. J. Carson Brevoort,
the distinguished bibliographer and historical
scholar, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,&mdash;who has
kindly communicated for my use his abundant
materials relating to the Cabots, and has laid
me under great obligations for aid in preparing
this paper,&mdash;he says he has been collating the
first part of the <i>Summario</i> of 1534 with the
Latin <i>Decades</i> of Peter Martyr, and he finds
them to differ in a way that no mere translator
would have ventured to effect; that in one
instance two books of the Decades are condensed
into a few lines, and the whole worked
over as an author only could do it. The Italian
Summary closes at the end of the ninth
book of the third Decade. He thinks that Ramusio,
with the edition of 1516 before him,
would not have omitted the tenth book. Mr.
Brevoort therefore is led to believe that Martyr
himself rewrote in 1515, in Italian, the
three Decades (the last book not having yet
been written) and sent the MS. to a friend in
Italy, where it slumbered until 1534, when it
fell into the hands of Ramusio, who committed
it to the press. This is a curious question in
bibliography.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It should be added here that the statements of
Martyr included in the Latin Decades of 1516
(afterward published in the entire work of 1530)
are so often referred to by the author, in the
course of his correspondence, that we are bound
to accept that edition as the genuine work. It
was published during his lifetime, and received
his <i>imprimatur</i>.</p>

It is supposed that a new edition of this
map was published in 1549, the year after Sebastian
Cabot returned to England. The only evidence
of this is contained in a thick duodecimo volume
first published in 1594, at Herborn, in Nassau,
edited by Nathan Chytræus, entitled <i>Variorum
in Europa Itinerum Deliciæ</i>,&mdash;a work consisting
of monumental and other inscriptions, antique
legends, and curious bits of antiquity in prose
and verse, picked up by the diligent compiler in
almost every country in Europe. He was in
England in 1565; and apparently at Oxford he
saw a document, “a geographical table,” under
which he found several inscriptions in not very
elegant Latin, which he copied and printed in
his volume, filling twenty-two pages of the book.
They are wholly in Latin, and correspond substantially
with the Latin inscriptions on the
Paris map described above. There is this
difference. The inscriptions here are but nineteen
in number, whereas on the Paris map there
are twenty-two, five of them in Spanish only.
No. xviii., of Chytræus, is in the body only of
the map, and in Spanish; and No. xix. appears
only in Spanish. In Chytræus each inscription
has a title prefixed, wanting, as a rule, on the
Paris map. There are some verbal variations
in the text, owing probably to the contingencies
of transcription and of printing. In the legend,
No. xvii., which has the title, “Inscriptio sev
titulus Auctoris,” the date 1549 is inserted as
the year in which the map to which the inscriptions
belonged was composed, instead of 1544,
as in the Paris map.</p>

The following extract of a letter from Sebastian
Cabot to the Emperor Charles V., dated
London, Nov. 15, 1554, speaks of a sea-chart intended
for his Majesty, and refers also to the
subject of the variation of the needle, which interested
Cabot in an especial manner:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“With respect to laying down the position of the coast
of Guinea conformably with the variation made by the needle
with the pole, if the King of Portugal falls into an error,
I give your Majesty a remedy.</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">“The same Francisco de Urista, whom I have named
before, takes with him to show to your Majesty two figures
which are: a mappe monde divided by the equator, from
which your Majesty can see the causes of the variation of the
needle, and the reasons why it moves at one time towards
the north, at another towards the south pole; the second
figure shows how to take the longitude on whatever parallel
a man happens to be. The results of both these the said
F. de U. will relate to your Majesty as I have here instructed
him fully about them, and as he is himself skilled in the
art of navigation. In regard to the sea-chart (?) which the
said F. de U. has, I have written to your Majesty before
about it, that it is of importance to your service, and also
[have written] about a relation in my own handwriting to
Juan Esquefe, your ambassador, to send it to your Majesty.
From what I am told, it is in the possession of the Secretary
Eraso. To it I refer you, and I assert that the chart will
be of great service in reference to the division line agreed
upon between the royal crown of Spain and Portugal for the
reasons set forth in my relation.</p>

The geographical designation here employed
has been thought by some to be very indefinite,
inasmuch as the Spaniards, who discovered
Florida, subsequently gave that name to
the whole country northward and westward of
the territory now bearing that name; but it must
be remembered that that designation was not accepted
by geographers of other nations. After
the voyages of Verrazano and Cartier the name
“La Nouvelle France” was applied by French
geographers to the territory as far down as 40°
N., and the name was sometimes applied to
the whole of North America. The maps of the
Italian geographer, Gastaldi, who made maps
for Ramusio’s third volume, and of Ruscelli, his
pupil, confined Florida to more southern limits;
and so did Sebastian Cabot himself, if the map
of 1544 was made by him. Indeed, in the conversation
of these Italian <i>savans</i> at the house of
Fracastor, that geographical status was assumed;
that is to say, the country of Cabot’s landfall,
and the land by which he sailed north and south,
was not understood to be Florida, for the statement
is that “he sailed down the coast by that
land toward the equinoctial, and came to that
part of this firm land which is now called Florida.”
Of course the point which he reached is
very indefinite. Peter Martyr had said, thirty-five
years before, that Cabot told him that he
went south <i>almost</i> to the latitude of the strait of
Gibraltar, which is in 36° N. Nobody knows
whether these two accounts relate to the same
voyage. That to which the conversation refers
is assumed by the narrator to be the voyage of discovery.
Indeed, for two hundred years and more
there was no suspicion that a voyage by the
Cabots followed immediately the voyage of discovery;
though some incidents are related which
may have taken place in a subsequent voyage,
and others which never took place at all. Modern
critics, who accept the above story as to the
latitude reached at the south, generally agree that
it was only on the second voyage that this was
accomplished.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a></span>
The conversation at Caphi, at the house of
Fracastor, who was a friend of Ramusio, took
place a short time only before its publication.
Ramusio says, in his report, “a few months ago.”
We do not know precisely when he wrote his report,
but there is a reference in it to a book of
Jacob Tevius, published in 1548. As I have
said above, we do not know the year of the interview
with Cabot at Seville. The narrator
says that it was “some years ago,” and I should
infer that it was some years after Cabot’s return
in August, 1530, from the La Plata expedition, to
which Cabot in the interview refers. He also
mentions that he is growing old, and retiring
from active duties. In 1540 he would probably
have been approaching seventy years of age, and
this date may safely be assumed as not far from
the time when the conversation took place. M.
D’Avezac, in <i>Revue Crit.</i>, v. 265, gives 1544 or
1545 as the probable date.</p>
<p class="pfc4">To the publication of this report relating
to Cabot, Hakluyt, in 1589, prefixed the name
of Galeacius Butrigarius, the Pope’s legate in
Spain, as the distinguished person who reported
the conversation with Cabot; and ever
since that time, down to the publication of Biddle’s
<i>Memoir of Sebastian Cabot</i>, in 1831, the
statement passed without question. Biddle, who
regarded the matter as of little moment, said
there was no authority for that name in Ramusio,
who says himself that he withholds it
from motives of delicacy; but Biddle did not say,
perhaps he did not observe, that Hakluyt got
the name from Eden (<i>Decades</i>, <i>f.</i> 252, <i>verso</i>), who
made the original blunder. Martyr, in the beginning
of his second Decade, written in 1515,
speaks of knowing Butrigarius of Bologna, when
the latter was of the Pope’s embassy in Spain;
and I find that he died in 1518, in the forty-third
year of his age (see Zedler’s <i>Universal Lexikon</i>,
v. 4, Halle, 1733). M. D’Avezac had noted, as
early as 1869, that Butrigarius had died thirty
years before the conversation took place at the
house of Fracastor, and also that the editor of
Ramusio, Tomaso Giunti, had added the word
Mantuan to this anonymous person’s name;
and now, through the researches instituted by
Charles Bullo and by the mediation of the superintendent
of the archives of the state at Venice,
it is ascertained that this unknown person
was Gian Giacomo Bardolo, of Mantua. See
<i>Intorno a Giovanni Caboto</i>, etc., by Cornelio
Desimoni, Genova, 1881, pp. 26, 27; also, in
<i>Atti</i>, vol. xv., of the Società ligure di storia
patria.</p>

Fracastor died Aug. 8, 1553, over seventy
years of age. He was a maker of globes. Humphrey
Gilbert says that he was a traveller in the
northern parts of America. (Kohl, p. 229; Hakluyt,

Eden’s <i>Decades</i>, fol. 318, corrected by the
original. [The first edition of Gomara is a
rare book, and a copy has been lately priced by
Quaritch at £36. It proved to be one of the most
popular of all the books of that century on the
New World; and, as we count, including varieties
of titles, there were more than a score of editions
in fifty years, so that his statements became
widely known. There were seven such issues in
Spanish, either in Spain or in Flanders, in two
years, when the demand for it seems to have
failed in its original tongue, and was transferred
to Italy, where at Rome and Venice there were
six editions in twenty years (1556 to 1576).
Sabin says eighteen in that interval, but I fail to
find them. There was a seventh near the end of
the century (1599). In 1568 or 1569 there seem
to have been three issues of the first French
translation, and six others followed, from 1577
to 1597. These statements are based chiefly on
the lists of editions given in Sabin, vii. 306 (said
to have been drawn up by Mr. Brevoort); in the

Mr. Brevoort has submitted some notes to
my attention, on this voyage. Rejecting the
year 1516-17 as impracticable, he adopts an
earlier date, before Cabot had left England, and
finds some authority for it in a book of George
Beste, London, 1578, on the three voyages of
Frobisher, hereafter to be mentioned. The
writer there gives 1508 as the year of Sebastian
Cabot’s discovery of North America, probably
never having heard of any previous voyages.
Mr. Brevoort thinks he had authority for a voyage
of Cabot about the year named. Thomas
Pert, or Spert, against whom the charge of
“faint heart” is alleged by Eden, is mentioned
in vol. i. of <i>Letters and Papers Foreign and Domestic,
Henry VIII.</i>, 1512, <span class="smcap">C.</span> 1514, as master of
the “Mary Rose,” and of the “Great Harry.” In
1514 he is pensioned, and in 1517 is placed on
shore duty. There is no report of him in 1516,
but as he was a veteran in 1514 it is hardly
probable that he would have been on a voyage
of discovery in 1516. He is usually mentioned
as Thomas Spert; only once is he called Pert.
As evidence that an expedition left England on
a voyage of discovery some time during the last
years of Henry VII., or during the early years
of his successor, the <i>Interlude of the Four Elements</i>,
of uncertain date, but probably written
before 1519, cited above, is adduced as showing
that the incident related occurred “not long
ago.” And certain verses which speak of the
disobedience of the mariners, which put an end
to the voyage, and to the hopes of the projector,
afford the earliest reference to the mutiny story.
Mr. Brevoort is of opinion that Eden’s vague
reference to an event occurring in the reign of
Henry VIII., “about the same year of his reign,”
was intended to place it in the 8th year of the
century. But that would bring it within the
reign of Henry VII.</p>

Mr. J. Winter Jones, the editor of the

concerning the original French edition of this
work, that it “is not known to exist, and it is
doubtful if it ever was printed.” Hakluyt, however,
in his “Discourse on Westerne Planting,”
published as vol. ii., <i>Doc. Hist. of Maine</i>, p. 20,
says it is “extant in print, both in French and
English”. [Sparks, in his <i>Life of Ribault</i>, p. 147,
says that he cannot find that the original French
was ever published; but Gaffarel, <i>Floride Francaise</i>,
says it was published in London, 1563, as

As the language of Hacket’s English version
of Ribault was accessible to me only through
Richard Hakluyt’s <i>Divers Voyages</i>, 1582, in
which he reprinted it, I had an ungenerous suspicion
that he might have substituted that date
for another, he having placed the year 1498
in the margin of the page on which he first
prints the alleged extract from Fabian. The
only known copy of Hacket’s translation is in
the British Museum, and on an appeal to that,
through a transcript of it taken for Mr. John
Carter-Brown, I find Ribault’s date to be 1498.

[Ortelius was not far from thirty years old,
when Sebastian Cabot died. He had been in
England, and possibly had seen the old navigator.
Felix Van Hulst’s account of Ortelius
was published in a second edition at Liege in
1846. Ortelius was the first to collect contemporary
maps and combine them into a collection,
which became the precursor of the modern atlas.
His learning and integrity, with a discrimination
that kept his judgment careful, has made his
book valuable as a trustworthy record of the
best geographical knowledge of his time. His
position at Antwerp was favorable for broadening
his research, and a disposition to better each
succeeding issue, in which he was not hampered
by deficiency of pecuniary resources, served to
spread his work widely. The first Latin edition
of 1570 was followed by others in that language,
and in Dutch, German, French, and Italian, with
an ever-increasing number of maps, and recasting
of old ones. These editions, including epitomes,
numbered at least twenty-six, down to
1606, when it was for the first time put into
English, followed by an epitome in the same
language, with smaller maps, in 1610. There
were a few editions on the continent during
the rest of that century (the latest we note
is an Italian one in 1697), but other geographers
with their new knowledge were then filling
the field.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Richard Eden died about this time, perhaps
in the previous year. He left among his papers
a translation, made “in the year of our Lord,
1576,” and from the Latin of Lewis Vartomannus,
which Willes includes in his own edition. The
last book published by Eden was an English
translation from the Latin of a book on navigation,
by Joannes Taisnierus, public professor
in Rome and of several universities in Italy.
It bears no date, but it is supposed to have been
issued in 1576 or 1577. See <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
pt. 1. p. 262, which puts its date 1576;
but it is given 1579 in Markham’s <i>Davis’s Voyages</i>.
In the Epistle Dedicatory, Eden speaks
of attending “the good old man,” Sebastian Cabot,
“on his death-bed,” and listening to his flighty
utterances about a divine revelation of a new
method for finding the longitude. See Biddle,
pp. 222, 223. Eden was also engaged in other
literary enterprises not mentioned by me.</p>

In the <i>Proceedings</i> of the American Antiquarian
Society for October, 1881, Mr. George
Dexter has traced the publication of this alleged
extract from Fabian to an earlier date than had
usually been assigned to it. It was published by
Stow, in his <i>Annals</i>, in 1580, together with the
paragraph relating to the savage men said to
have been brought home by Sebastian Cabot,
and also printed by Hakluyt in 1582. They
were also printed in the second edition of Holinshed,
1586-87. The Cotton manuscript, Vitellius,
A. xvi., has been re-examined, and proves
not to be a Fabian. Mr. Dexter has printed the
two extracts from it, the latter, relating to the
“savage men,” for the first time. In the Cotton
collection, Nero, C. xi., is a genuine Fabian, but
it contains nothing about Cabot. The conclusion
to which I have arrived from this examination
by Mr. Dexter is, that the Vitellius
manuscript was not the original used by Stow
and Hakluyt. They give facts and details not
to be found in that manuscript; and this remark
will particularly apply to the extract relating to
the three savage men, which in the Vitellius is
brief and meagre. Both Stow and Hakluyt
must have used a genuine Fabian manuscript
yet to be discovered. For though neither would
probably hesitate to add or change a name or
a date, if he thought he had sufficient authority
for so doing, they would not manufacture a
narrative.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As regards the savage men referred to, Stow,
under the date of 1502, says they were that
year presented to the King, yet that they were
brought over by Sebastian Cabot in 1498, giving
Fabian as his authority. Hakluyt, in his quarto
of 1582, repeats the same story, on the same authority;
yet in his folio of 1589 he changes the
date in his heading as to the year of their presentation
to the King, making it conform to the
year in which they were brought over. Mr. Biddle
(<i>Memoir of Sebastian Cabot</i>, pp. 230, 231) has
a labored argument to show that the men were
not brought over by Cabot, but by some one
else, in the year they were presented to the
King, 1502, reflecting severely on Hakluyt for
changing this last date. It is not at all probable
that the name of either John Cabot or Sebastian
Cabot was given in the original manuscript
used by Stow and Hakluyt. I will add
that George Beste, in his work on the voyages
of Frobisher, cited above, says that Sebastian
Cabot brought home “sundry of the people”
of the country he visited, “and many other
things, in token of possession taken,” very
oddly assigning the voyage, which he regarded
as the voyage of discovery, to the year 1508.</p>

I had called attention to this fact in some
notes on Cabot’s map in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
Am. Antiq. Soc. for April, 1867, and Dr. Kohl,
p. 371, says that Locke is supposed to have copied
the inscription from a map of Cabot in England.
The fact must have been inscribed on some
other map of Cabot than the recently recovered
one in Paris, for that certainly does not bear out
the conjecture.</p>

In the year 1584 Richard Hakluyt, at the
request of Sir Walter Raleigh, wrote a <i>Discourse
on Westerne Planting</i>,&mdash;to which I have already
made a brief reference,&mdash;supposed to embody
the opinions of the statesmen of England at that
period on the colonization of North America.
It is a remarkable paper, intended for the eye of
the Queen. After giving all the reasons why
England should enter upon this work speedily,
he presents, in chapter xviii. “the Queen of
England’s title to all the West Indies, or at
least to as much as is from Florida to the circle
Arctic,” as being “more lawful and right than
the Spaniards’, or any other Christian princes’;”
and the claim is based mainly on the discovery
by Sebastian Cabot, in the year 1496, as related
in the first volume of Ramusio, which is cited.
Hakluyt is anxious to make it appear that Cabot
discovered North America before Columbus discovered
the firm land of the Indies; yea, more
than a year before, and he recurs more than once
to this date as showing the fact. Indeed, he
once goes so far as to cite the date on Clement
Adams’s map, 1494, as carrying the claim yet
farther back. [The history of this manuscript,
published as vol. ii. of the <i>Documentary History
of Maine</i>, is traced in an Editorial note to Dr.

This book of Mr. Biddle was published in
London in two editions, 1831 and 1832, and
in the United States, 1831, all without the
name of the author, an eminent jurist and
statesman of Pittsburg, Penn., who was born
in 1795, and died in 1847. It is a work of great
value for its authorities, and displays much critical
talent; and though composed with little
system and with a strong bias in favor of Sebastian
Cabot, whom the author makes his hero, it
may be regarded as the best review of the history
of maritime discovery relating to the period of
which he treats, that had appeared.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[The most important notice of Mr. Biddle’s
book occurred in Tytler’s <i>Historical View of the
Progress of Discovery on the more Northern Coasts
of America</i>, Biddle’s reflections upon Hakluyt being
the particular occasion of a vindication of
that collector. George S. Hillard also reviewed
Biddle in the <i>North American Review</i>, xxxiv. 405,
and it elicited other essays in contemporary
journals. It supplied largely the material for
Hayward’s <i>Life of Cabot</i> in Sparks’s <i>American
Biography</i>. The most recent treatment of the
subject is in a condensed and somewhat enthusiastic
<i>Remarkable Life, Adventures and Discoveries
of Sebastian Cabot</i>, by J. F. Nicholls, the public
librarian of Bristol, London, 1869. This writer
ascribes the chief glory to Sebastian and not to
the father, and rather grandly lauds his achievements.
This provoked Henry Stevens to putting
a note in his <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 1870, no. 2519,
in vindication of John Cabot’s greater claim,&mdash;a
view he again emphasized in a little tract, with
the expressive mathematical title, <i>Sebastian Cabot-John
Cabot = O</i>: Boston, 1870. Some of the
later information has been embodied by Bancroft
in a paper on Cabot in the <i>New American Cyclopædia</i>,
which he has used again in vol. i. of his Centenary
Ed. <i>History of the United States</i>. A very
good resumé of existing knowledge as it stood
forty-five years ago, is given in Conway Robinson’s
<i>Discoveries in the West and Voyages along
the Atlantic Coast</i>, Richmond, 1848. A somewhat
similar treatment is given in Peschel’s <i>Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, book ii.,
ch. 6, and notice may also be taken of the same
author’s <i>Geschichte der Erdkunde</i>, vol. iv. Fox
Bourne, in his <i>English Seamen under the Tudors</i>,
gives a summary of the Cabots’ career as explorers,
and in his <i>English Merchants</i> he treats of
their relation to British commerce and the enterprise
of Bristol. Mr. Travers Twiss communicated
some papers on the relative influence of
Columbus and Cabot on American Discovery to
the <i>Nautical Magazine</i>, July and August, 1876;
and a review of a somewhat similar kind will be
found in Admiral Jurien de la Gravière’s <i>Les
Marins du xv<sup>e</sup> et xvi<sup>e</sup> Siècles</i>, composed of papers
which had originally appeared in the <i>Revue des
deux Mondes</i>, 1876, <i>et seq.</i> Among other views,
reference may be made to F. von Hellward’s
<i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, 43 pp.; Malte-Brun’s <i>Annales des
Voyages</i>, xcix., p. 39.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

M. D’Avezac, in the <i>Bulletin de la Soc.
Géog.</i>, Quar. Ser., xiv., 271, 272, 1857, and Dr.
Asher in his <i>Henry Hudson</i> (Hakluyt Soc.),
pp. lxviii, 261, 1860, both express the opinion
that Clement Adams deliberately altered the
date from 1494 to 1497, the latter being the date
copied by Hakluyt into his extract from Adams’s
map, as published in the third volume of his fol.
of 1600; neither of these writers being aware of
the fact that in Hakluyt’s first citation from
Adams’s map, in his folio of 1589, the date 1494
was given. All we know of Adams’s map is
derived from Hakluyt; and as an additional evidence
that the extract cited from it bore the date
1494, we have Hakluyt’s previous statement, in
his <i>Discourse on Westerne Planting</i>, cited above,
where this fact is clearly affirmed.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Am. Antiq. Soc.
for April, 1867, I called attention, in some notes
on Cabot’s map, to the inadvertences of these
distinguished historians; and, in a later paper
by M. D’Avezac, printed in the <i>Bulletin de la
Soc. Géog.</i>, in Paris for 1869, and translated in
the <i>Doc. Hist. of Maine</i>, i. 506, 507, he revises
his opinion, and affirms his belief that the change
of date from 1494, in Hakluyt’s first folio, to
1497 in that of 1600 was caused by a typographical
error. [D’Avezac’s paper was entitled: <i>Les
navigations Terre-neuviennes de Jean et Sébastien
Cabot&mdash;Lettre au Révérend Leonard Woods</i>: and
was also printed separately in Paris.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

It has been suggested that Hakluyt had
access to Cabot’s papers in possession of William
Worthington, and that they revealed the true
date. It is a pity he did not “make note of
it” among his authorities. See R. H. Major’s
<i>True Date of the English Discovery</i>, etc., London,
1870, originally printed in the <i>Archæologia</i>,
xliii, 17.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The mention of the name of William Worthington,
against whom Mr. Biddle has emphasized
a suspicion of unjust dealing with Sebastian
Cabot, reminds me of a remark of M. D’Avezac
in speaking of the marriage of Cabot to Catherine
Medrano,&mdash;that he suspected that Worthington,
instead of being hostile to Cabot, was, on
the contrary, bound to him by family ties. See
<i>Revue Critique</i>, v. 268, 269.</p>

See vol. i. 226, 274; ii. 243, 267; iii. 10;
cf. Biddle, 184-187, 311, who doubts as to Cabot’s
appointment as “grand pilot,” as asserted by
Hakluyt. [Davis, in his <i>World’s Hydrographical
Descriptions</i>, does not give him any official title
in 1595. “Sebastian Gabota, an expert pilot,
and a man reported of speciall judgment, who
being that wayes imployed returned without successe.”

The Legend no. xvii. of the map is copied
from Chytræus into the text of the <i>Tabularum
Geog. Contractatrum</i> of Peter Bertius, published
in Latin and in French. In the Latin edition of
1602 or 1603, the second edition, the Legend is
given on page 627, and in the French of 1617 on
page 777. The text is ascribed to Jodocus
Hondius, who died in 1612, says Lelewel, in his
<i>Géographie du Moyen Age</i>. (<i>Letter of J. Carson
Brevoort.</i>)</p>

Among the many works whose publication
was inspired by Hakluyt, was the issue in 1612
of an English version of the eight <i>Decades</i> of
Peter Martyr, translated by Michael Locke, thus
laying before the English reader whatever that
industrious chronicler had written concerning
Sebastian Cabot. The first three Decades, as
we have already seen, had been translated by
Richard Eden, many years before, and those were
now adopted by Locke into his completed version;
the work was entitled <i>De Novo Orbe, or the
History of the West Indies</i>, etc., London, 1612. It
contained a Latin dedication to Sir Julius Cæsar,
and an address in English to the reader. The
same sheets were also issued with another titlepage
without date, and omitting the Latin dedication,
and also again in 1628 with a new title,
calling the book a second edition. [Copies of
either issue are worth from £5 to £10, and even
more. Fifty years ago Rich (1832, no. 130)
priced one at £1 16<i>s.</i> The text was reprinted
in the supplement to the 1809 edition of Hakluyt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">Purchas has several notices of the Cabots
taken from Hakluyt principally, hereafter the
great authority cited, and from Ramusio. His
is the earliest mention made, within my knowledge,
of Sebastian Cabot’s picture in Whitehall
gallery, but he speaks of it as though it were
displayed on Clement Adams’s map hanging
there. He probably never took the trouble to
visit the gallery himself, but wrote from wrong
information.</p>
<p class="pfc4">[Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimage</i> gave his own form and
language to the accounts of the voyages which
he collected, and those in his eighth and ninth
book concern America. It was published in
1613, when he was thirty-six years old. There
was a second edition in 1614, and a third with
additions in 1617, the year after Purchas inherited
Hakluyt’s manuscripts. He now set
about his greater work,&mdash;<i>Hakluytus Posthumus,
or Purchas, his Pilgrimes</i>,&mdash;in which he changed
his method, and preserved the language of the
narratives, which he brought together. This
was published in four volumes (part of the third
and all of the fourth volume pertaining to America),
in 1625; and the next year a new edition of
his first work was brought out, which has ever
since constituted the fifth volume of the entire
work. The set has nearly or quite quadrupled in
value during the last fifty and sixty years, and
superior copies are now worth £100; such a
copy however must contain the original engraved
frontispiece with its little map of the world,
which is seldom found, and “Hondius his
Map of the World,” which is rarer still, on
page 95, where ordinary copies show a reduplication
merely of the map properly belonging on
page 115. Mr. Deane owns Thomas Prince’s
copy of the American portions, which are enriched
with Prince’s notes. Samuel Sewall’s
copy is in Harvard College Library. Purchas
survived the publication but two years, and died
in 1628. His service to the cause in which he
and Hakluyt were so conspicuous workers, was
great, but is not generally accounted as equal to
that of the elder chronicler. See Clarke’s <i>Maritime
Discovery</i>, i. xiii., and the references in Allibone’s
<i>Dictionary</i>. Bohn’s Lowndes p. 2010,
is useful in determining the collation, which is
confused.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bacon, in his <i>Life of Henry VII.</i> published in
1622, notices the voyage of Sebastian Cabot, in
which North America was discovered; but mentioning
no year implies that it took place in
1498. His principal authority seems to have
been Stowe’s <i>Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A valuable work was published at Madrid in
1629, by Pinello D. Ant. de Leon, entitled an
<i>Epitome de la bibliotheca oriental i occidental,
nautica i geographica</i>, etc. of which a second
edition, edited by De Barcia, was published in
1737-38. Particular mention is made in it of the
several editions of the writings of Peter Martyr,
though the information is not always correct.
He says that Juan Pablo Martyr Rizo, a descendant
of Peter Martyr, had a manuscript translation
in Spanish of the Decades for printing, which we
may well believe never appeared.</p>

Mr. J. F. Nichols, in his <i>Life of Sebastian
Cabot</i>, pp. 20, 21, appears to misapprehend the
terms of this privilege of naturalization, supposing
it was a grant of citizenship for fifteen
years to come, and not on account of fifteen
years’ residence already passed. The memorandum
reads: “Quod fiat privilegium civilitatis
de intus et extra Joani Caboto per habitationem
annorum xv. juxta consuetum,”&mdash;“That
a privilege of citizenship, within and without, be
made for John Cabot, as usual, <i>on account</i> of a
residence of fifteen years.” That such is the
proper interpretation of the grant is shown by
the full document itself, issued four years previously
to another person, and referred to in the
Register, where the privilege to John Cabot is
recorded. The document recites that “Whereas,
whoever shall have dwelt continuously in Venice
<i>for a space of fifteen years or more</i>, spending that
time in performing the duties of our kingdom,
shall be our citizen and Venetian, and shall enjoy
the privilege of citizenship and other benefits,”
etc. Then follows the statement that the
person applying had offered satisfactory proofs
that he <i>had dwelt continuously in Venice for fifteen
years</i>, and had faithfully performed the
other duties required, and he was thereupon
declared to be a Venetian and citizen, within
and without, etc. (See <i>Intorno a Giovanni
Caboto</i>, etc., by Cornelio Desimoni, Genova,
1881, pp. 43-45.)</p>

M. D’Avezac believed that Sebastian Cabot
was born in 1472 or 1473, and that John Cabot
and his family removed to England not far from
the year 1477. He infers this last date from a
conviction that John Cabot early engaged in
maritime voyages from Bristol, and that the
mention of a vessel sailing from that port in
1480, belonging to John Jay the younger, conducted
by “the most skilful mariner in all
England,” pointed to John Cabot as the real
commander. And he thought he derived some
support for this opinion from some passages in
the letter of D’Ayala, the Spanish ambassador,
mentioned farther on, in regard to voyages made
from Bristol to the west for several years before
the date of his letter. See Corry’s <i>History of
Bristol</i>, i. 318, a work not accurate in relation to
the Cabot voyages; cf. Botoner, <i>alias</i> William
Wyrcestre, in <i>Antiquities of Bristol</i>, pp. 152, 153.</p>

Strachey, in his <i>Historie of Travaile into

<p class="pfc4 p1">“This year (1497), on St. John’s the Baptist’s Day,
the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristowe,
in a ship of Bristol called the ‘Matthew,’ the which
said ship departed from the port of Bristow the 2d of May,
and come home again 6th August following.”</p>

the Cabot (Paris) map. See also “The Discovery
of North America by John Cabot in 1497,”

Geneal. Reg.</i> (Oct. 1878), xxxii. 381 [who reproduces
also a part of the same map, and gives a
sketch-map marking Cabot’s track around the
Gulf. He bases his argument partly on Pasqualigo’s
statement that Cabot found the tides “slack,”
and shows that the difference in their rise and
fall in that region is small compared with what
Cabot had been used to, at Bristol. In the confusion
of the two Cabot voyages, which for a
long while prevailed (see an instance in <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> x. 383, under date, 1663), the
track of his first voyage is often made to extend
down the eastern seaboard of the present
United States, and it is thus laid down on the
map in Zurla’s <i>Di Marco Polo e degli viaggiatori
Veneziani</i>, Venezia, 1818. Stevens, <i>Hist. and
Geog. Notes</i>, does not allow that on either voyage
the coast south of the St. Lawrence was
seen; and urges that for some years the coast-line
farther south was drawn from Marco
Polo’s Asiatic coasts; and he contends for
the “honesty” of the Portuguese Portolano of
1514, which leaves the coast from Nova Scotia
to Charleston a blank, holding that this confirms
his view. It may be a question whether
it was honesty or ignorance. Dr. Hale, <i>Amer.
Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i> Oct. 21, 1871, gives a sketch-map
to show the curious correspondence of
the Asian and American coast lines. Observe
it also in the Finæus map, already

Of course, neither John Cabot nor Sebastian
could furnish ships at his own charge, any
more than Columbus could. Raimondo says
that John was “poor,” and the acceptance by
him of small gifts from the King proves it. He
was probably aided by the wealthy men of Bristol,
with whom he may have taken up a credit.</p>

<p class="pfc4">In a work entitled <i>Armorial de la Noblesse de
Languedock</i>, by M. Louis de la Roque, Paris, 1860,
vol. ii. p. 163, there is an account of the family
of Cabot in that Province. The writer says that
this family derived its name and origin from
Jean Cabot, a Venetian nobleman who settled in
Bristol in the reign of Henry VII.; was a distinguished
navigator, the discoverer of Terre Neuve,
thence passing into the service of Spain; that
he had three sons,&mdash;Jean (who died in Venice),
Louis, and Sebastian (who continued in the service
of England and died in France without posterity);
that Louis, here called the second son,
settled at Saint-Paul-le-Coste, in the Cévennes,
had a son Pierre, who died Dec. 27, 1552, leaving
a will, by which is shown his descent from
Jean the navigator, through his father Louis.
Through Pierre the family is traced down to the
present time. The arms of the family are given:
<i>Device</i>, “D’azur à trois chabots d’or;” motto,
“Semper cor cabot Cabot,”&mdash;the same as those
of the ancient family of Cabot in the island of Jersey,
whence the New England family of Cabot
sprung. Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge, in the introduction
to his <i>Life of George Cabot</i>, has given
reasons for believing that the French family
was derived from that of Jersey. The three
sons of John Cabot named in the letters patent
of March 5, 1496, are Louis, Sebastian, and Sancius,
the last of whom is not named in the list
here cited.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It may well be doubted if Jean Cabot is properly
styled above “a Venetian nobleman.” See
the grant of denization to him in Venice, the
several letters patent to him of Henry VII., and
the letter of Raimondo on page 54. In the statement
that he entered into the service of Spain, he
is evidently confounded with his son Sebastian,
who, it may be added, did not die in France, but
in England. Whether Sebastian left posterity is
not known, but he had a wife and children while
he was living in Spain. Referring to the motto
of the family here given, I may add that the
motto on Sebastian’s picture is “Spes mea in
Deo est.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mention is made on page 31 of a portrait
of Sebastian Cabot, till recently attributed to
Holbein, painted in England when Cabot was
a very old man, of which a copy taken in 1763
now hangs in the Ducal Palace in Venice. At
a meeting of the French Geographical Society,
April 16, 1869, M. D’Avezac stated that M. Valentinelli,
of Venice, had recently sent to him a
photograph copy of a portrait of John Cabot,
and one of his son Sebastian Cabot, at the age
of twenty years, after the picture of Grizellini,
belonging to the gallery of the Ducal Palace.
He proceeded to say that some guarantee for
the authenticity of the picture of Sebastian was
afforded by some traces of resemblance between
it and the well-known portrait of him by Holbein
at the age of eighty-five years (<i>Bulletin de la
Soc. de Géographie</i>, 5 ser. to. 17, p. 406). The
existence of a portrait of Sebastian Cabot taken
at so early an age, before he left Venice to live
in England, would be an interesting fact if authentic.
An authentic picture of John Cabot, the
real discoverer of North America, would have
even higher claims to our regard. Prefixed to a
Memoir of “Giovanni Cabotto,” by Carlo Barrera
Pezzi, published at Venice in 1881, which
has just come under my notice, is a medallion
portrait, inscribed “Giovanni Cabotto Veneziano.”
It is not referred to by the author in
the book in which it is inserted.</p>

In this narrative is an account of tobacco
twenty years before that luxury was introduced
into England by Ralph Lane. The account is
in these words (the grammar is defective, but
the copy is accurate): “The Floridians, when
they travel, have a kinde of herbe dryed, which
with a cane and an earthen cup in the end, with
fire, and the dried herbs put together, do sucke
thoro the cane the smoke thereof, which smoke
satisfieth their hunger, and therewith they live
foure or five days without meat or drinke, and
this all the Frenchmen vsed for this purpose:
yet do they holde opinion withall that it causeth
water and fleame to void from their stomacks.”
It is a little curious that he should thus connect
tobacco with Florida, as if he had not observed
its use in the West Indies. It had, indeed, been
used in Southern Europe before this time.</p>

One hundred and forty years later, Daniel
De Foe, a devoted Christian man, wrote his
celebrated biography of Robinson Crusoe, who,
when he had been long living in Brazil as a
planter, met his critical shipwreck in a voyage
to the African coast for slaves. The romance
is intended by its author to be what we call a
religious novel. The religious experiences of
the hero are those to which De Foe attached
most importance. In the relation of these experiences
he enumerates and repents his “manifold
sins and wickedness.” But among these,
although he regrets his own folly in risking so
much in the pursuit of wealth, it is never intimated
that there is anything wrong in dragging
these wretched negroes unwilling from their
homes: so slow had been the development
of the spirit of humanity in the sixteenth and
even the seventeenth century, and so ill defined
were the rights of man!</p>

their ships from the Moluccas crossed the ocean
eastward and struck the coast of California. It

[It is a question how far north Drake went.
Up to the middle of the last century, the writers,
except Davis in his <i>World’s Hydrographical
Discovery</i>, and perhaps Sir William Monson, had
fixed his northing at 43°,&mdash;these two exceptions
placing it at 48°, and this last opinion has
been followed by Burney, Barrow, and the writer
of the Life of Drake in the 1750 edition of the
<i>Biographia Britannica</i>. Greenhow, <i>Oregon and
California</i>, 2d edition, p. 74, doubts the later
view. Drake’s aim was to find the westerly end
of what was for a long time the conjectural
Straits of Anian, or the northern passage to the
Atlantic, which, ever since Cortereal, in 1500,
had found what he supposed the easterly end
of such a passage in Hudson’s Straits, had been
a dream of navigators and geographers. An
examination of the unstable views which were
held regarding the shape and inlets of the western
coast of North America, from the time of
Cortes’ first expedition north, belongs to another
volume of this work. A notion of the
continuity of Asia and America, which was temporarily
dispelled by Balboa’s discovery of the
Pacific in 1513, was revived twenty years later
by a certain school of geographers, and continued
to be held by some for thirty or forty
years. Before Drake’s time it had given place
to views which more distinctly prefigured the
Straits of Behring, not yet to be determined
for a hundred and fifty years. The earlier conjectural
propinquity of America and Asia at
the north&mdash;as shown in the maps of Münster,
Mercator, and others&mdash;was giving place to a
more minute configuration, as shown in the
maps of Zaltieri and Furlano, of which outlines
are given in the text, indicating the kind
of view which was prevailing regarding this
northern part of the Pacific, which Drake was
baffled in his attempt to explore. It is curious
to observe, moreover, that Mercator in his
map in zones, dated 1541, marks the region
later to be called New Albion as having the
star <i>Caput Draconis</i> in the zenith,&mdash;almost in
strange anticipation of its being the spot where
the English “dragon” was first to contest Spanish
supremacy on the North American continent.
Spain had as yet had no sharer of this
northern new world.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

they were in form of a round room.” The

Colonel John D. Washburn, in a very careful
paper in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, no.
58, 1872, suspects from Torquemada’s account
(1615, published at Seville), as cited in the English
version of Father Venegas’s <i>History of California</i>
(Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, 1,599, 1,600),
that the port visited by Viscaino was Jack’s Bay,
as indeed the original Spanish of Venegas (iii.
III) distinctly says. Cf. also John T. Doyle’s
paper, with an introduction by Colonel Washburn
in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, October, 1873.</p>

[The coast-survey authorities have usually favored San Francisco. This was the opinion of Alexander
Forbes in his <i>California</i>, 1839, where he gives (p. 127) an interesting view of the bay before commerce had
marked it. Dr. Stillman, in the <i>Overland Monthly</i> (October, 1868, March, 1869), and later in his <i>Seeking the
Golden Fleece</i> (p. 295), has advocated San Francisco. S. G. Drake, in the <i>American Historical Record</i>,
August, 1874, took the same view.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Greenhow, in the second edition (1845) of his <i>Oregon and California</i>, p. 74, does not think the question can
be definitely settled between San Francisco and Bodega.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There have been many disputes over Jack’s Bay,&mdash;the Sir Francis Drake Bay of the maps. Soulé and
the writers of the <i>Annals of San Francisco</i> accept it as the spot; so does Kohl. Professor J. D. Whitney
(<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, art. “California”) says the evidence points strongly to Jack’s Bay.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Vancouver seems to have reported the story of the Spaniards calling it Sir Francis Drake’s Bay. Captain
Beechey thought it too exposed to have deserved Drake’s description; and it has been held he could not have
graved his ship in it. It is claimed, however, that Limantour’s Bay, which opens through an inlet westwardly
from Jack’s Bay, answers the required conditions of water and shelter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 21; Stevens’s <i>Nuggets</i>, no. 921; Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, no. 20,853. S. G. Drake
bought a copy in Boston in 1844 for $4. It was priced by Vaux in 1853 at as many pounds, and is worth much
more now. The later editions are worth somewhat less. S. G. Drake (<i>Genealogical Register</i>, i. 126) gives a
partial list of those who accompanied Drake, being about one-third of his one hundred and sixty-four men.
Among the fullest of the modern narratives are those in Barrow’s <i>Life of Drake</i>, and in Froude’s <i>England</i>,
vol. xi. chap. 29. [But Mr. Froude has used his valuable authorities carelessly. He depends in part upon
some reports of Spanish officers, which exist in manuscript in Spain, and upon some which are in England,
brought home by English cruisers. One of the most interesting, which should still be in the national library
in Madrid, I found in 1882 had been cut from the volume and carried away.&mdash;E. E. H.]</p>

Hakluyt, vol. iii., or quarto edition, vol. iv.; Harris, vol. i.; Oxford, vol. ii. Hakluyt also gives the relation
of Nuna da Silva, a Portuguese pilot whom Drake had captured, and who made his report to the Viceroy
of Spain, and John Winter’s account of his companionship with Drake. Vaux collates his text with a manuscript
preserved in the British Museum, which may have been the collection of Fletcher’s notes which the compiler
of <i>The World Encompassed</i> used. Several narratives are also in the Callender collection of <i>Voyages</i>,
Edinburgh, 1766. There are German versions in Gottfried and Vander Aa (1727, vol. xviii.), Cornelius Claesz
(1598, 1603), etc. Appended to the <i>Begin en Voortgangh</i> (1645 and 1646) of Isaac Commelin, of Amsterdam,
is sometimes a Dutch narrative of the voyages of Candish, Drake, and Hawkins, “described by one of the
fleet,” and with an imprint of 1644, which is very rare. Frederic Muller says, in his <i>Books on America</i>, 1872
(no. 1,871), that he had never seen but the one then described, and another, sold to Stevens in 1867.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A French edition, <i>Le Voyage de François Drack alentour du Monde</i>, was originally issued in Paris in 1613,
and is now scarce, and sometimes priced at 300 francs. There were other editions, with additions, in 1627 (Sabin,
vol. v. no. 23,845), 1631, 1641, 1690. Bohn’s <i>Lowndes</i>, p. 668. The Dedicatory Epistle is signed F. de Lorrencourt.
Leclerc, <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, no. 2,743. The title of the later edition runs: <i>Le Voyage curieux faict
autour du Monde</i>, etc. Muller’s <i>Books on America</i> (1877), no. 973. [This curious book affects in the dedication
to be an original narrative: “I dedicate it to you, Monsieur, because you gave it to me, telling me that you
received it from one of your subjects of Courtomer, who had made the voyage with this gentleman.” On
examination, however, it proves that the narrative is a rough translation, not very accurate, and generally
abridged from that in Hakluyt: generally, but not always; for in a few instances details of local color are
added, which I think important, and which appear, so far as I know, in no other narrative. With no apparent
purpose but to make the book bigger, a second part is added, entitled <i>Seconde Partie des Singvlaritez
remarquees aux isles et terres fermes du Midy et des Indes Orientales: par l’Illustre Seigneur et Chevalier
Francois Drach, Admiral d’ Angleterre</i>. It is a botch of travels in Africa, the Indian Ocean, and America,
in places mostly which Drake never saw.&mdash;E. E. H.]</p>

<i>Huth Catalogue</i>, ii. 442. Leclerc, no. 2,744, prices the maps alone at 400 francs; and Quaritch, in 1877,
advertised them for £50. The Lenox Library has a copy with the four maps, and a second copy with different
vignettes on the title.</p>

Quaritch prices a copy at £10 10<i>s.</i>; Stevens, Nuggets, puts one at £5 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Hakluyt’s third volume
(1600) gives the narrative. In some copies of Hakluyt’s volume of 1589 there is found, before page 644, a
broadside, giving a journal from Drake’s log-book, Sept. 14, 1585, to July 22, 1586. (Sabin, vi. 543.) It was on
this voyage that Drake on his return visited the new settlement in Virginia, as mentioned in chap. iv. of the
present volume.</p>

Quaritch, in 1877, claimed that only three copies of this map were known, and only four or five complete
sets of the other four are known. The mappemonde is in the Grenville copy, and was in a copy possessed by
Rodd, the London dealer, fifty years ago. Baptista B. (or Boazio) seems to have been the designer or engraver.
There is also a copy of this fifth map in the Lenox Library.</p>

The <i>Huth Catalogue</i> also gives all five maps to the first edition (52 pages); says the errata are corrected
in the second edition, and the words “with geographical mappes,” etc., are left out of the title; while for the
third edition (copy in the King’s Library, in the British Museum) a smaller type is used, contracting it to 37
pages. An edition of 1596 is sometimes cited, but it is doubtful if such exists. Lowndes mentions a somewhat
doubtful French edition of the same year.</p>

Mr. J. P. Collier printed a small (one hundred copies) fac-simile edition of the 1596 book; but most of the
copies were destroyed by fire. <i>A full Relation</i> of this voyage, dated 1652, was included in the 1653 edition of

For a Drake bibliography we must go to Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, v. 20,827, etc., and Bohn’s Lowndes.
Stevens (<i>Historical Collections</i>, vol. i. no. 202) notes a collection of copies from manuscripts in public depositaries
in England which had been brought together as materials for writing a memoir of Drake. As a Devonshire
hero, Drake figures in the local literature of Plymouth and its neighborhood.</p>

A paper read by George Dexter, Esq.,
before the Massachusetts Historical Society,
Oct. 13, 1881, upon “The First Voyage under Sir
Humphrey Gilbert’s Patent of 1578,” corrects
an error into which Mr. Edwards had fallen
about this voyage, and shows that it was undertaken
in 1578 instead of 1579, as stated by Mr.
Edwards, and that Ralegh was the captain of one
of the vessels. A few additional references may
serve the curious student. Some new material
was first brought forward in the <i>Archæologia</i>,
vols. xxxiv. and xxxv. Ralegh’s career in Ireland
is followed in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, Nov. 1881.
His last year is considered in Gardiner’s <i>Prince
Charles and the Spanish Marriage</i>. A contemporary
account of his execution from Adam Winthrop’s
note-book is printed in the <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, Sept. 1873. A psychological study
may be found in Disraeli’s <i>Amenities of Literature</i>.
Two American essays may be mentioned,&mdash;that
in Belknap’s <i>American Biography</i>, and J.
Morrison Harris’s paper before the Maryland
Historical Society in 1846.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As to the story at one time prevalent of
Ralegh’s coming in person to his colony, Stith,

mistranslation of the Latin. Cf. Force’s <i>Tracts</i>

[A notice of the original English issue of
Hariot (1588) is described on a later page as the
second original production relating to America
presented to the English public (see notes following
Dr. De Costa’s chapter); but it became
more widely known in 1590, when De Bry at
Frankfort made it the only part of his famous
Collection of Voyages, which he printed in the
English tongue, giving it the following title: <i>A
briefe and true report of the new found land of
Virginia, of the commodities, and of the nature and
manners of the naturall inhabitants</i>. <i>Discovered
by the English colony there seated by Sir Richard
Greinuile in the yeere 1585.... This forebooke is
made in English by Thomas Hariot. Francoforti
ad Moenvm, typis Joannis Wecheli, svmtibus vero
Theodori de Bry</i>, cicicxc. It is also the rarest of
the parts, and only a few copies of it are known,
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">1. Carter-Brown Library. <i>Catalogue</i>, i. 397,
where a fac-simile of the title is given.</p>
<p class="pfc4">2. Lenox Library.</p>
<p class="pfc4">3. Sold in the Stevens Sale (no. 2487), Boston,
1870, to a New York collector for $975. This
was made perfect by despoiling another copy
belonging to a public collection.</p>
<p class="pfc4">4. Harvard College Library; imperfect.</p>
<p class="pfc4">5. Grenville copy in the British Museum,
bought at Frankfort for £100 in 1710 (?).</p>
<p class="pfc4">6. Bodleian Library.</p>
<p class="pfc4">7. Christie Miller’s collection, England.</p>
<p class="pfc4">8. Sir Thomas Phillipp’s collection, England;
imperfect.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Rich in 1832, <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 71, had a copy
which was made up, and which he priced at £21,
but would have held it at £100 if perfect.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A photo-lithographic fac-simile edition of this
English text was issued in New York from the
Stevens copy in 1871-72, about 100 copies, which
is worth $20. (<i>Griswold Catalogue</i>, no. 309.)
The original may be worth $1000.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the same year, 1590, De Bry also issued it
in Latin, German, and French. Brunet gives
three varieties of the original Latin issue, besides
two varieties of a counterfeit one. The
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 322, gives the collations
of the five varieties slightly varying; cf.
Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. iii.; Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 653. There was a second (1600)
and third edition of the German version (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, pp. 354, 355; also for the
French, p. 329). A German translation by
Cristhopher P&mdash;&mdash; is also contained in Matthæus
Dresser’s <i>Historien von China</i>, Halle,
1598; cf. Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, v. 536; <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, i. 429.</p>
<p class="pfc4">De Bry engraved the drawings which White
made at Roanoke, or rather a portion of them;
for nearly three times as many as appear in De
Bry, who copied only twenty-three, are now in
the collection of drawings as preserved in the
British Museum. What De Bry used may possibly
have been copies of the originals, and in
any case he gave an academic aspect to the more
natural drawings as White made them. Henry
Stevens secured the originals in 1865, and in a
fire at Sotheby’s in June of that year they became
saturated with water, so that a collection
of offsets was left on the paper which was laid
between them. Mr. Stevens sold the originals
for £210, and the offsets for £26 5<i>s.</i>, both to the
British Museum, in 1866; and his letter offering
them and telling the story is in his <i>Bibliotheca
Historica</i>, 1870, cf. <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc.
Proc.</i> Oct. 20, 1866. In the Sloane Collection
are also near a hundred of White’s drawings;
see E. E. Hale in <i>Archæologia Americana</i>, iv.
21. One section of Hariot’s paper, entitled
“Of the nature and maners of the people,”
appeared in the author’s original English in
the Hakluyts of 1589 and 1600, and also in De
Bry, who likewise added to his English Hariot
a statement called, “The true pictures and
fashions of the people in that parte of America
now called Virginia,” etc. This statement is not
in the printed Hakluyts, though it is said by De
Bry to have been “translated out of Latin into
English by Richard Hackluit.” It is there said
of the pictures that they were “diligently collected
and drowne by John White, who was sent
thiter speciallye by Sir Walter Ralegh, 1585,
also 1588, now cutt in copper, and first published
by Theodore De Bry att his wone chardges.”
De Bry’s engravings have often been reproduced
by Montanus, Lafitau, Beverly, etc. Wyth’s, or
White’s “Portraits to the Life and Manners of
the Inhabitants,” following De Bry, with English
text, was printed at New York in 1841.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The map which accompanies Hariot’s narrative,
as given by De Bry, was procured by him
from England, and is subscribed “Auctore
Joanne With,”&mdash;once De Bry writes it “Whit.”
It was made in 1587, and Kohl in his <i>Maps relating
to America mentioned in Hakluyt</i>, pp. 42-46,
thinks that there can be no doubt With is John
White, the captain, and that he based, or caused
to be based, his drawing on observations made by
Lane, who had been in the Chesapeake, while
White had not. Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>,
1870, p. 222, identifies the John White the artist
with Governor John White. A largely reduced
fac-simile of this map is herewith given, for
comparison with the Coast Survey chart of the
same region. Other fac-similes of the original
are given in the Histories of North Carolina by
Hawks and Wheeler, in Gay’s <i>Popular History of
the United States</i>, i. 243. It was later followed
in the configurations of the coast given by Mercator,
Hondius, De Laet, etc. The map which
is given in Smith’s <i>Generall Historie</i> as “Ould
Virginia” closely resembles White’s, which
however extends farther north, and includes the
entrance of the Chesapeake. There had been
one earlier representation of “Virginia” on a
map, and that was in Hakluyt’s edition of Peter
Martyr on a half globe. De Bry also gives a
bird’s-eye view of Roanoke and its vicinity.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

by Williamson and Wheeler in their histories of
North Carolina. Some of them are printed in

[His narrative of the first voyage was published
in 1596, the year following his voyage,
and was called <i>The Discoverie of the large, rich
and bewtiful empire of Guiana, with a relation of
the Great and Golden Citie of Manoa (which the
Spanyards call El Dorado)</i>, etc. <i>Huth Catalogue</i>,

507. I have compared Mr. Charles Deane’s
copy. There are three copies of this in the
Lenox Library, with such variations as indicate
as many contemporary editions. Quaritch recently
priced a copy at £20.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Ralegh had written this tract in large part on
his voyage, when he made the map of Trinidad
and that of Guiana, which he mentions as not yet
finished. Kohl, <i>Maps relating to America</i>, etc.,
p. 65, thinks he has identified this drawing of
Ralegh in a MS. map in the British Museum,
which was acquired in 1849. The text of the
<i>Discoverie</i> was reprinted in Hakluyt, iii. 627;
in the Oldys and Birch’s edition (Oxford, 1829) of
<i>Ralegh’s Works</i>, vol. viii.; in Pinkerton’s <i>Voyages</i>,
xii. 196; in Cayley’s <i>Life of Ralegh</i>. The Hakluyt
Society reprinted it under the editing of
Sir R. H. Schomburgk, who gives a map of the
Orinoco Valley, showing Ralegh’s track. Colliber’s
<i>English Sea Affairs</i>, London, 1727, has a
narrative based on it; Sabin, iv. 14414.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There was a Dutch version published at Amsterdam
in 1598 by Cornelius Claesz; and it is
from this that De Bry made his Latin version,
in his part viii., 1599 (two editions), and 1625,
also in German, 1599 and 1624. Also see part
xiii. (1634). There were other Dutch editions
or versions in 1605, 1617, 1644. Muller, <i>Books
on America</i>, 1872, no. 1268, and 1877, no. 2654;
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 454. It also formed
part v. of Hulsius’s Collection of Voyages, and
the <i>Lenox Library Bibliographical Contribution
on Hulsius</i> gives a Latin edition, 1599, and German
editions of 1599, 1601, 1603, 1612, 1663, with
duplicate copies of some of them showing variations.
See Asher’s <i>Bibliography</i>, p. 42; Camus’s
<i>Mémoire</i>, p. 97; Meusel’s <i>Bibliographia Historica</i>,
vol. iii. There are also versions or abridgments
in the collections of Aa, 1706 and 1727, and
Coreal, 1722, and 1738.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The report of Captain Lawrence Keymis was
printed at London in 1596, of which there is a
copy in Harvard College Library. See <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 500; it is also given
in Hakluyt. Kohl cannot find that either Keymis
or Masham made charts, but thinks their
reports influenced the maps in Hondius, Hulsius,
and De Bry.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The accusations against Ralegh in regard to
his Guiana representations have been examined
by his biographers. Tytler, ch. 3, defends him;
Schomburgk shields him from Hume’s attacks;
so does Kingsley in <i>North British Review</i>, also
in his <i>Essays</i>, who thinks Ralegh had a right to
be credulous, and that the ruins of the city may
yet be found. Napier in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
later in his <i>Lord Bacon and Ralegh</i>, clears him
of the charge of deceit about the mine. Van
Heuvel’s <i>El Dorado</i>, New York, 1844, defends
Ralegh’s reports, and gives a map. See Field’s
<i>Indian Bibliography</i> no. 1595. St. John, in his
<i>Life of Ralegh</i>, ch. xv., mentions finding Ralegh’s
map in the archives of Simancas. See also the
Lives by Edwards, ch. x.; by Thompson, ch. ii.;

military advantages, was begun by the Federal

It has been assumed in America that the
descendants in Virginia of Pocahontas were
limited to those springing from the marriage
of Robert Bolling with Jane, the daughter of
Thomas Rolfe; but it appears that the last left
a son, Anthony, in England, whose daughter,
Hannah, married Sir Thomas Leigh, of County
Kent, and that their descendants of that and
of the additional highly respectable names of
Bennet and Spencer are quite numerous. See

Its relevancy has recently been questioned

The engraver was William Hole, engraver

acknowledgment of Virginia as the
fifth kingdom. After the union of England and
Scotland in 1707, the motto, to correspond with
the altered number of kingdoms, was <i>En dat
Virginia quartam</i>, the adjective agreeing with

This was not the only material effort made.
In 1621, under the zealous efforts of the Rev.
Patrick Copland (the chaplain of an East India
ship), funds were collected for the establishment
of a free school in Charles City County, to be
called the East India School. For its maintenance
one thousand acres of land, with five servants
and an overseer, were allotted by the
Company.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The advantage of private education, in the
families at least of the more provident of the
planters, was increasingly secured by the employment
as tutors of poor young men of education,
who came over from time to time, and by
indenture served long enough to pay the cost of
their transportation. Later in the seventeenth
century, all whose means enabled them to do
so educated their sons in England,&mdash;a custom
which largely continued during the following
century, though William and Mary College had
been established in 1692.</p>

City, and later returned to Ireland. His son,

missionaries sent from New England in 1642,
and declining to take the oath of conformity,
removed in May, 1644, to Boston. He afterwards
became eminent in New England, was

In 1687, and again in 1696, Colonel William
Byrd, the first of the name in Virginia,
undertook the revival of the iron-works at Falling
Creek; but there is no record preserved of
his plans having been successfully carried out.
New iron-works were, however, erected here by
Colonel Archibald Cary prior to 1760, which
he operated with pig-iron from Maryland, but
in the year named he abandoned the forge because
of its lack of profit, and converted his
pond to the use of a grist-mill. The site of the
works of 1622 on the western bank of the creek,
and that of Cary’s forge of 1760 on the opposite
side of the same water, have both been
identified by the present writer by the scoriæ
remaining about the ground. The manufacture
of iron in Virginia was revived by Governor
Alexander Spotswood at Germanna about
1716.</p>

It was fully three quarters of a century
thereafter before Dissent became appreciable in
the colony. Governor Spotswood wrote the
Bishop of London, Oct. 24, 1710: “It is a peculiar
blessing to this Country to have but few of
any kind of Dissenters;” and adds the following,
which may be taken in refutation of many
gross misrepresentations of the moral and social
condition of the colonists at the period: “I have
observed here less Swearing and Prophaneness,
less Drunkenness and Debauchery, less uncharitable
feuds and animositys, and less Knaverys
and Villanys than in any part of the world
where my Lot has been.” He also wrote to the
Council of Trade, Dec. 15, 1710: “That happy
Establishment of the Church of England, which
the Colony enjoys with less mixture of Dissenters
than any other of her Majesty’s plantations;”
and to the Earl of Rochester, July 30,
1711, in ample confirmation of his earlier judgment,
he wrote: “This Government, I can joyfully
assure your Lordship, is in perfect peace
and tranquility under a due Obedience to the
Royal Authority and a Gen<sup>ll</sup>. Conformity to the
Established Church of England.” See <i>The Official
Letters of Governor Alexander Spotswood</i>,

The quit-rent was one shilling for every
fifty acres of land, the latest consideration in its
acquirement. It was first granted to the Adventurers,
by the Company, in tracts of one hundred
acres, after five years’ service in the colony.
If planted and seated within three years, the
quantity was augmented by another hundred
acres. Later, each person removing to the
colony at his own expense, with the intention to
settle and remain, was entitled to fifty acres of
land. The right extended also to every member
of his family or person whose passage-money
he defrayed. These rights upon “transports”
were called “head-rights,” and were assignable.</p>

This is shown by the preservation of books
to this day in the several departments of literature
which are identified, by ownership in inscribed
name and date, with the homes of the
Virginia planter of the seventeenth century,
many of which have fallen under the personal
inspection of the present writer, who has some
examples in his own library. A little later,
private libraries were numerous in Virginia, and
in value, extent, and variety of subject embraced,
the exhibit will contrast favorably with that of
any of the English colonies in America.</p>

The editor of the tract, “J. H.,” in his
preface, says: “Some of the books were printed
under the name of Thomas Watson, by whose
occasion I know not, unlesse it were the ouer-rashnesse
or mistakinge of the workmen.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The words “by a gentleman” got also through
ignorance of the real authorship into the titles of
some copies as author, there being four varieties
of titles. It is sometimes quoted (by Purchas for
instance) by the running head-line <i>Newes from
Virginia</i>. Mr. Deane edited an edition of it at
Boston in 1866. There are eight copies of it
known to be in America: one each belonging
to Harvard College, S. L. M. Barlow, and the
Carter-Brown Library; two in the New York
Historical Society, and three in the Lenox Library.
(<i>Magazine of American History,</i> i. 251.)
The text is the same in all cases, and those
copies in which Smith’s name is given have an
explanatory preface acknowledging the mistake.
Mr. Payne Collier, in his <i>Rarest Books in the English
Language</i>, 1865, is of the opinion that Watson
was the true author, which Mr. Deane shows to
be an error. An earlier, very inaccurate reprint
was made in the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>,
February, 1845, from the New York Historical
Society’s copy. Use is also made of it in Pinkerton’s
<i>Voyages</i>, vol. xiii. [Mr. Deane suggests
that the reason Smith omitted this tract in
his <i>Generall Historie</i>, substituting for it the
<i>Map of Virginia</i>, is to be found in the greater
ease with which the narratives of others in the
latter tracts would take on the story of Pocahontas,
which his own words in the <i>True Relation</i>
might forbid.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Tyler, <i>History of American Literature</i>, i. 26,
calls this tract of Smith’s the earliest contribution
to American literature. The latest copy
sold which we have noted was in the Ouvry
Sale, London, March, 1882, no. 1,535 of its

A portrait of “Captaine George Percy,”
copied in 1853 by Herbert L. Smith from the
original at Syon House, the seat of the Duke
of Northumberland, at the instance of Conway
Robinson, Esq., then visiting England, is among
the valuable collection of portraits of the Virginia
Historical Society at Richmond. Its frame,
of carved British oak, was a present to the Society
from William Twopenny, Esq., of London,
the solicitor of the Duke of Northumberland.
Percy (born Sept. 4, 1586, died unmarried in
March, 1632) was “a gentleman of honor and
resolution.” He had served with distinction in
the wars of the Low Countries, and his soldierly
qualities were evidenced in the colony, as well as
his administrative ability as the successor of John
Smith. A mutilated hand represented in the
portrait, it is said, was a memorial of a sanguinary
encounter with the savages of Virginia. The
head from this portrait is given on an earlier
page.</p>

The author of the “Relatyon,” etc., was
identified by the late Hon. William Green,
LL.D., of Richmond, as Captain Gabriel
Archer. [Newport’s connection with the colony
is particularly sketched in Neill’s <i>Virginia
and Virginiola</i>, 1878. Neill describes the MS.
which is in the Record office as “a fair and
accurate description of the first Virginia explorations.”
Mr. Hale later made some additions
to his original notes (<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>,
Oct. 21, 1864), where some supplemental notes
by Mr. Deane will also be found as to the origin
of the name Newport-News as connected with
Captain Newport. See H. B. Grigsby in <i>Mass.

This iconoclastic view was also sustained by
Mr. E. D. Neill in chapter v. of his <i>Virginia Company
in London</i>, 1869, which was also printed
separately, and in chapter iv. of his <i>English
Colonization in America</i>. He goes farther than
Mr. Deane, and, following implicitly Strachey’s
statement of an earlier marriage for Pocahontas,
he impugns other characters than Smith’s, and
repeats the imputations in his <i>Virginia and
Virginiola</i>, p. 20. There is a paper on the
marriage of Pocahontas, by Wyndham Robertson,
in the <i>Virginia Historical Reporter</i>, vol. ii.
part i. (1860), p. 67. (Cf. Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
p. 383.) See Neill’s view pushed to an
extreme in <i>Hist. Mag.</i> xvii. 144. A writer in the
<i>Virginia Hist. Reg.</i> iv. 37, undertook to show
that Kokoum and Rolfe were the same. Matthew
S. Henry, in a letter dated Philadelphia,
Sept. 11, 1857, written to Dr. Wm. P. Palmer,
then Corresponding Secretary of the Virginia
Historical Society, gives us the Lenni Lenape
signification of Kakoom or Kokoum, as “‘to
come from somewhere else,’ as we would say,
‘a foreigner.’”</p>

Its place is sometimes supplied by a fac-simile
engraved for W. Richardson’s <i>Granger’s
Portraits</i>, 1792-96. The original Mataoka or
Pocahontas picture was neither in the Brinley,
the Medlicott, nor the Menzies copies, and is
not in the Harvard College, Dowse, Deane, or
in most of the known copies.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Crowninshield copy (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 992)
had the original plate; and that copy, after
going to England, came back to America as the
property of Dr. Charles G. Barney, of Virginia,
and at the sale of his library in New York in
1870 it brought $247.50; but it is understood
that it returned to his own shelves. The Carter-Brown
(1632) edition, the Barlow large-paper
copy, and one copy at least in the Lenox Library
have it.</p>

There exists at Heacham Hall, Norfolk,
the seat of the Rolfes, a portrait thought to be

Grigsby’s authority for his statements was
the son of Sully, who also painted an ideal portrait
of Pocahontas. Copies of a picture of Pocahontas
by Thomas Sully, and of another painted
by R. M. Sully are in the Collections of the Virginia
Historical Society, and it is palpable that
they are both mere fanciful representations. The
original of the picture which was at Cobb’s, the
writer was informed by the late Hon. John Robertson,
a descendant of Pocahontas, represented
“a stout blonde English woman,”&mdash;a description
which does not agree with the picture by
Robert M. Sully purporting to be a copy.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The late Charles Campbell, author of a <i>History
of Virginia</i>, stated that Thomas Sully was
allowed to take the original from Cobb’s (it
being little valued), and that after cleaning it
he altered the features and complexion to his
own fancy. Of the picture by Thomas Sully he
states: “The portrait I painted and presented
to the Historical Society of Virginia was copied,
in part, from the portrait of Pocahontas in the
‘Indian Gallery,’ published by Daniel Rice and
Z. Clark. In my opinion the copy by my nephew
[Robert M. Sully] is best entitled to authenticity.”</p>

On the signification of this word see “The
Lost City of New England” in <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, i. no. 1, and printed separately.
The most notable monograph that has appeared
in connection with the general subject is that by
M. Eugène Beauvois, entitled, <i>La Norambegue.
Découverte d’une quatrième colonie Pré-Colombienne
dans le Nouveau Monde</i>. Bruxelles, 1880, pp.
27-32. This very learned author labors with
great ingenuity to prove that the word is of old
northern origin, and that by a variety of transformations,
which he seeks to explain, it means
Norrœnbygda, or the country of Norway; and
that, consequently, it must be regarded as showing
the early occupation of the region by Scandinavians.
[Cf. also the paper by the same
author on “Le Markland et l’Escociland,” in
<i>Congrès des Américanistes; Compte rendu</i>, 1877,
i. 224.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] To the claim that the word is
of Indian origin we may oppose the statement in
Thevet’s <i>Cosmographie</i> (ii. 1009), evidently derived
by that mendacious writer from an early
navigator, to the effect that, while the Europeans
called the country Norumbega, the savages
called it Aggoncy. Father Vetromile reported
that he found an Indian who knew the word
Nolumbega, meaning “still water;” yet he does
not say whether he recognized it as an aboriginal
or an imported word. [Vetromile, <i>History of the
Abnakis</i>, New York, 1866, p. 49; and assented to
by Murphy, <i>Verrazano</i>, p. 38. Father Vetromile
says in a letter: “In going with Indians in
a canoe along the Penobscot, when we arrived at
some large sheet of water after a rapid or narrow
passage, men would say <i>Nolumbeghe</i>.” Dr.
Ballard, in a manuscript, says the coast Indians
in our day have called it <i>Nah-rah-bĕ-gek</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Folio, 557. A copy of the manuscript is preserved
in the British Museum, Sloane manuscripts,
1447, and one is also in the Bodleian, Tanner manuscripts,
79. They present no substantial variations.
Hakluyt accepts the relation in his “Discourse,”
2 <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i> ii. 115-220, [but
his editor, Charles Deane, thinks it “has all the
air of a romance or fiction.” The Sloane copy
was followed by P. C. T. Weston, who privately
printed it in his <i>Documents Connected with the
History of South Carolina</i>, London, 1856 (121
copies), with the following title: “The Land
Travels of Davyd Ingram and others in the years
1568-69 from the Rio de Minas in the Gulph of
Mexico to Cape Breton in Acadia.” A manuscript
copy in the Sparks Collection (<i>Catalogue</i>,
App. No. 30) is called “Relaçon of Davyd Ingram
of things which he did see in Travellinge by
lande for [from?] the moste northerlie pte of the
Baye of Mexico throughe a greate pte of Ameryca
untill within fivetye leagues of Cape Britton.”
Mr. Sparks has endorsed it: “Many parts of this
narrative are incredible, so much as to throw a
distrust over the whole.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Purchas, iv. 1179. Ingram’s reference to
Elephants reminds the reader of the Lions of
the Plymouth colonists (Dexter’s <i>Mourt</i>, p. 75).
In this connection consult the <i>Rare Travailes</i>
of Job Hortop, who was put ashore with Ingram,
being twenty-two years in reaching England.
Cabeça de Vaca, who came to America with
Narvaez in 1528, was six years in captivity, and
spent twenty months in his travels to escape.
At this period there were Indian trails in all
directions for thousands of miles; on these Ingram
and his companions travelled. See, for
the Indian trails, <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 326.</p>

The relation of Pring’s voyage is derived
from Purchas, iv. 1654 and v. 829, where it is
attributed to Pring himself. [It should be noted
that the identifying of Whitson Harbor with the
modern Plymouth was first brought forward by
Dr. De Costa in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, January, 1878. It has generally been held
that Pring doubled Cape Cod, and reached what
is now Edgartown Harbor in Martha’s Vineyard,
or some roadstead in that region. Such is the
opinion of Bancroft, i., cent. ed., 90; Palfrey, i.

<p class="pfc4">[Belknap had employed a well-known Massachusetts
navigator, Captain John Foster

of Rosier’s journal in hand. His theory, even
of late years, has had some supporters like

R. K. Sewall in his <i>Ancient Dominions of
Maine</i>, 1859, and <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 188, follow
McKeene; as does Dr. De Costa himself in
the Introduction to his <i>Voyage to Sagadahoc</i>,
and General Chamberlain in his <i>Maine, her
place in History</i>. George Prince was the first
to advocate the George’s River, and his views
were furthered by David Cushman in the same
volume of the <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i> Prince, in
1860, reprinted Rosier’s <i>Narrative</i>, still presenting
his view in notes to it.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This essay by Prince incited Cyrus Eaton,
a local historian (whose story has been told
touchingly by John L. Sibley in the <i>Mass.

<i>History of Thomaston, Rockland, and South
Thomaston</i>, which he published at the age of
eighty-one years, having prepared it under
the disadvantage of total blindness. In this

It should also be observed that Captain

a trade, about 1621, upon the coast of New
England, between Cape Cod and Delaware
Bay, in 40° north latitude, granted to Sir Walter
Raleigh in 1584, and afterwards confirmed
and divided by agreement by King James,
in 1606. The plantations in Virginia have
been settled about forty years; in New England
about twenty-five years. The Hollanders
came as interlopers between the two, and
have published a map of the coast between
Virginia and Cape Cod, with the title of “New
Netherlands.” <i>Calendar of State-papers</i> (Colonial),
1574, p. 166, by Sainsbury, London, 1860,

See <i>Cabo de Baxos, or the Place of Cape Cod,
in the old Cartology</i>, by B. F. De Costa, New York,

<p class="pfc4">[The Editor dissents from the views given in
this elaborate tract and adopted in the text of the
present chapter; and thinks that Cape Cod, and
not Sandy Hook, is the conspicuous peninsula
which appears on the early maps. In the general
coast-line Cape Cod is a protuberant angle, while
Sandy Hook is in the bight of a bay which forms
an entering angle, and, unlike Cape Cod, is of no
significance in relation to the trend of the continental
shore. There is the least difficulty, in the
matter of the bearings of one point from another,
with considering this feature to be Cape Cod;
and we must remember that the compass was the
only instrument of tolerable precision which the
early navigators had, and its records are the only
ones to be depended upon. It is accordingly
never safe to discard the record of it, unless under
strong convictions as to a misreading of its evidence.
The Editor does not receive such convictions
from the moderate variations of latitude,
which often were one or two degrees or even
more out of the way in the old maps; nor from
the coast names, which by no means were constant
in position, and were not infrequently sadly
confused and made to appear more than once
under translated forms. The process of copying
such from antecedent maps was far more liable
to error than the transmission of the general
direction and the sinuosities of the coast line.
The cartographers sometimes scattered names,
seemingly for little purpose but to fill up spaces.
Coast names, before settlements were fixed, were
of the utmost delusiveness, except sometimes in
the case of isolated features, not to be confounded.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<i>Mourt’s Relation</i>, p. 21. Mr. S. H. Gay has
suggested (<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, xlviii. 616) that
this landing was not at Plymouth, but on the
shore more directly west of Clark’s Island (Duxbury
or Kingston), and that consequently the
commemoration of a landing at Plymouth on
that day rests on a false foundation; but the
Rev. Henry M. Dexter, D.D., has conclusively
shown (<i>Congregationalist</i>, Nov. 9, 1881) that the
soundings must have led the explorers, unless
the deep-water channels have unaccountably
changed since then, directly to the neighborhood
of the rock which a chain of trustworthy
testimony on the spot identifies as the first landing-place
of any of the “Mayflower” company
within Plymouth Harbor. Tradition divides the
honor of being the first to step on Plymouth
Rock between John Alden and Mary Chilton,
but the date of their landing must have been
subsequent to December 11.</p>

Priest, Tinker and Soule, are names found
in the records of parishes near Scrooby (Palfrey’s
<i>History of New England</i>, i. 160), and it
is not unlikely that Degory Priest, Thomas
Tinker, and George Sowle, of the “Mayflower,”
may have come from this region. It is also said
by Mr. W. T. Davis (<i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, lxiv.
254, January, 1882, “Who were the Pilgrims?”),
that a William Butten’s baptism is found in
Austerfield, under date of Sept. 12, 1589. But
it would be hazardous to identify this man of
thirty-one years with the “William Butten, a
youth, servant to Samuel Fuller,” who died on
the “Mayflower’s” voyage to America. It is
also believed that Miles Standish was a scion
of the Standish family of Duxbury Hall, Lancashire.
[This view is encouraged, if not established,
by the expressions of Standish’s own will,
which is printed in <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, v.
335. The story of Standish’s career has been more
than once reviewed of late years, on account of
the efforts, not yet completed, to erect a tower to
his memory on Captain’s Hill, in Duxbury. Its
proposed height is not yet reached; and when
completed, it will bear his effigy on its top.
There were <i>Proceedings</i> printed to commemorate
the consecration of the ground, Aug. 17, 1871,
and on laying the corner-stone, in 1872. It is
known that Standish was never of the Pilgrim
communion; and “Was Miles Standish a Romanist?”
is discussed in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
i. 390. The inventory of his books is given in
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, i. 54. Bartlett,
<i>Pilgrim Fathers</i>, and the illustrated edition of
Longfellow’s <i>Poems</i>, 1880, give some views connected
with the English family. On the descendants
of the Captain, see <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, 1873, p. 145; Winsor’s <i>Duxbury</i>; Savage’s
<i>Dictionary</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the origin of Carver, their first governor,
nothing is known. Cf. N. B. Shurtleff, in <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1850, p. 105; 1863, p. 62;
and 1872, p. 333. The Howlands were long supposed
to be his descendants through the marriage
of his daughter to the Pilgrim John Howland,
and the modern inscription on the latter’s
monument on the Burial Hill, at Plymouth,
repeats a story seemingly disproved by the recovery
of Bradford’s manuscript history, which
states that Howland married a daughter of another
Pilgrim, Edward Tilley. A recent revision
of the story, by W. T. Davis, in the <i>Boston Daily
Advertiser</i>, Nov. 25, 1881, rather urging the traditional
belief, was met by Charles Deane, in <i>Ibid.</i>,
Dec. 7, 1881, who showed that John Howland, Jr.,
was born in Plymouth, in 1626, and could not
have sprung from an earlier marriage of John, Sr.,
with Carver’s daughter. The decision turns upon
the identity of “Lieutenant Howland,” as mentioned
by Sewall, being met near Barnstable. It
is barely possible that Joseph Howland, and not

[Winslow’s tract was reissued unchanged
in 1649, as <i>The Danger of tolerating Levellers in
a Civill State</i>. There are copies in the Lenox,
Charles Deane, and Carter-Brown libraries. A
copy is worth, perhaps, $100. Winslow’s report
of Robinson’s sermon seems to have been a reminiscence
of his own, twenty-five years after the
event. It is not decided when it was delivered.
It has usually been held to represent advanced
and liberal views; but Dr. Dexter dissents, and
says that “polity, and not dogma, is the keynote
of the still noble farewell.” See <i>Congregationalism</i>,

The Bibliographical Appendix to Dr. H. M.
Dexter’s <i>Congregationalism as seen in its Literature</i>,
mentions nine of these imprints, viz., nos.
459, 467, 470, 475, 476, 478, 481, 482, 495. Three
or four others are also known. See the <i>Brinley
Catalogue</i>, no. 530. [Brewster’s career has been
made the subject of an extended memoir, <i>Chief
of the Pilgrims</i>, Philadelphia, 1857, as it is somewhat
unsatisfactorily called. It has merit in
tracing the European existence of the Pilgrim
Church, but is unfortunately disfigured (p. 350)
in a minor part by some genealogical fabrications
imposed upon the author, the Rev. Ashbel
Steele. (Cf. Savage’s <i>Genealogical Dictionary,
sub</i> “Brewster.”) Dr. Dexter, <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1864, p. 18, in examining the evidence
for his birth, puts it in 1566-67; so that at
his death, in 1644, he was seventy-seven, or possibly
seventy-eight. See Mr. Neill, <i>Hist. Mag.</i>,
xvi. 69, and cf. Mr. Deane, <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xii. 98; also Poole’s <i>Index</i>, p. 160.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The well-known trembling autograph of the
Elder (given in fac-simile on an earlier page) is
one of the sights in the Record Office at Plymouth,
where it appears attached to a deed, as recorded,&mdash;a
practice not uncommon in the days when the
colony was small. This was long thought to be
the only signature known, while it was a cause of
some surprise that no one of the four hundred
volumes of his library (given by title in his
inventory,&mdash;<i>Plymouth Wills</i>, i. 53) had been
identified by bearing his autograph. Three of
these books, however, have since been found,&mdash;one
a Latin Chrysostom, Basil, 1522, now in the
Boston Athenæum, bears his autograph, with
the motto, “Hebel est omnis Adam,” which is
also found, as shown in the fac-simile in Steele’s
<i>Chief of the Pilgrims</i>, in another volume, similarly
inscribed, now at Yale College Library.
The fact that the Athenæum volume bears evidence,
in another inscription, of having belonged
to Thomas Prince, the grandson of the Elder,
and son of the governor of the colony of the
same name, and of his receiving it in July,
1644, while the Elder died in the preceding
April, would seem to indicate that the Pilgrim’s
collection of books was distributed among his
relatives. The Rev. Dr. Dexter, in his <i>Congregationalism</i>,
gives a fac-simile of an autograph
of Brewster written at an earlier period than
the others; and this is found in a third volume
belonging to Dr. Dexter, and numbered 211 in
his <i>Bibliography</i>. Hunter, in his <i>Founders of
New Plymouth</i>, p. 86, has shown how close a
resemblance the autograph of James Brewster,
the master of the hospital near Bawtry, and
friend of Archbishop Sandys, bears to the Elder’s
signature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[Dr. Punchard’s work was unfortunately left
incomplete. See <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
1880, p. 325, and <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xviii. 3.
The painstaking student will doubtless compare
these works with Dr. Waddington’s <i>Hidden
Church</i> and <i>Cong. Hist.</i>, in which, however, Dr.
Dexter seems to have little confidence. (Cf. his
<i>Congregationalism</i>, pp. 70, 201, 211, 262, 322, and
his article in the <i>Cong. Quarterly</i>, 1874.) The
<i>Hidden Church</i> was published in 1864, with an
Introduction by E. N. Kirk. (Cf. <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1864, p. 219; and 1881, p. 195.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the archives of the English Church at
Amsterdam there is a document, signed by Ant.
Walæus and Festus Hommius, theological professors
at Leyden, dated May 25-26, 1628, testifying
to Robinson’s exertions to remove the
schisms between the various Brownist congregations
in the Low Countries, and his resolution,
upon discouragement, to remove “to the West
Indies, where he did not doubt to effect this object.”
A photo-lithographic copy of this paper
has been issued (Muller’s <i>Books on America</i>, 1877,
no. 2,780). The contemporary rejoinders to Robinson’s
arguments can be seen in Samuel Rutherford’s
<i>Due Rights of Presbyteries</i>, London, 1644.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The student will not neglect Hanbury’s <i>Historical
Memorials relating to the Independents</i>,
London, 1639-44; R. Baillie’s <i>Anabaptism</i>, London,
1647, and Catherine Chidley’s <i>Justification
of the Independent Churches</i> (? 1650). The distinction
between the Puritans and the Pilgrims
is maintained in Dr. Waddington’s books; in
Dr. I. N. Tarbox’s papers in the <i>Congregational
Quarterly</i>, vol. xvii., and in the <i>Old Colony
Hist. Soc. Papers</i>, 1878; in an appendix, p. 443,
to Punchard, vol. iii.; in Benjamin Scott’s <i>Lecture</i>,
London, 1866, reprinted in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>,
May, 1867, from which is mostly derived a paper
in <i>Scribner’s Monthly</i>, June, 1876. Scott also
printed a lecture, “An Hour with the Pilgrim
Fathers and their Precursors,” in 1869. (Cf. <i>N.

probably written in
1652, was printed with

it; and this condensation was reprinted,
with notes, in 1802, by Dr. Freeman in <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, viii. 203; but in 1819 Dr. Freeman
and Judge Davis procured from a copy in the
Philadelphia Library the parts omitted by Purchas
in <i>Ibid.</i>, xix. 26. (Cf. <i>Proceedings</i>, i. 279.)
Dr. Young first printed it entire in his <i>Chronicles</i>.
Dr. Cheever, in 1848, gave it with disorderly and
homiletical editing in his <i>Journal of the Pilgrims</i>.
Dr. Dexter used Charles Deane’s copy. There
are other copies in the Carter-Brown and S. L.
M. Barlow libraries. (Cf. <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no.
1,909; <i>Menzies Catalogue</i>, no. 1,447; <i>Crowninshield

Rich, in his 1832 <i>Catalogue</i>, 164 and 171, priced
a copy at £2 2<i>s.</i>, and in his 1844 <i>Catalogue</i> at
£1 8<i>s.</i>; Quaritch recently held one at £36.
Doctors Young and Dexter agree that “G.
Mourt” must represent George Morton. A
previous note has given Dr. Dexter as the
best authority for tracing the localities named
in this journal. See, also, Freeman’s <i>Cape Cod</i>
and De Costa’s <i>Footprints of Miles Standish</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mourt makes no record of the landing from
the “Mayflower” being upon a <i>rock</i>, nor does he
indicate the precise spot, or fix a commemorative
day. In an earlier note mention has been made
of a recent controversy on these points. Mr.
Gay found an earlier opponent than Dr. Dexter
in Mr. William T. Davis, <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>,
Nov. 17, 1881, to which Mr. Gay replied, Nov.
30, 1881; and again Mr. Davis rejoined, Dec.
3, 1881. As to the mistake of celebrating
the 22d instead of the 21st December, which
arose from the Committee of the Old Colony
Club adding for the change of style one day too
many, a Committee of the Pilgrim Society in
1850 recommended a change in the commemoration
day; but though for a few years followed,
it has not effected a permanent compliance, and
by a recent vote of the Society the 22d has been
re-established. The 1850 Report was printed.
(Cf. <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, iv. 350, 369)
Mr. Gay, in the <i>Popular History of the United
States</i>, i. 393, takes another view of the mistake.
It was in 1769 that the Plymouth people determined
to institute a celebration, and fixed upon
the day, December 11, Old Style, when the
exploring party from the “Mayflower,” then in
Provincetown harbor, first landed on the mainland
and explored it.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Attempts have been made to trace the
earlier and later career of the “Mayflower.”
Mr. Hunter, in an appendix to his <i>Founders of
New Plymouth</i>, p. 186, has shown how common
the name was. She is thought to have been
identical with one of Winthrop’s fleet ten years
later; but the slaver “Mayflower,” with which
she has been sometimes identified, was a larger
vessel. Cf. <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1871,
p. 91, and 1874, p. 50; <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>,
Domestic Series, April 12, 1588.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of Samoset, the Indian whom the colonists
first encountered after landing, there are accounts
in Dexter’s edition of Mourt’s <i>Relation</i>; Sewall’s
<i>Ancient Dominion of Maine</i>, p. 101; <i>Popham
Memorial</i>, by Professor Johnson, p. 297; Thornton’s
<i>Pemaquid</i>, p. 54; and in <i>Maine Hist. Coll.</i>,
v. 186.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mourt’s <i>Relation</i> and Winslow’s <i>Good News</i>
give the earliest accounts of the Indians in the
Pilgrims’ neighborhood, who had been nearly
exterminated by a recent plague. (<i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, v. 130.) Of Massasoit and his family,&mdash;this
chief being the nearest sachem,&mdash;Fessenden’s
<i>History of Warren, R. I.</i>, gives an account.
See also E. W. Peirce’s <i>Indian History,
Biography, and Genealogy pertaining to the good
Sachem Massasoit and his descendants</i>, North
Abington, 1878. Drake, in his <i>Book of the
Indians</i>, book ii. chap. ii., and in the <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1858, p. 1, examines the
colonists’ relations with the Indians. See <i>Congregational
Quarterly</i>, i. 129, for a paper, “Did
the Pilgrims wrong the Indians?” Their efforts
to Christianize them are examined in the Appendix

<p class="pfc4">It was at Plymouth (1631-1633) that Roger
Williams drew up his treatise attacking the
validity of the titles acquired under the patents
granted by the king, in accordance with the common-law
principle as understood at the time.
Acceptance of his views as to the sole validity
of the Indian title would have disturbed the
foundations of the colony’s government; and it
was not without satisfaction that the authorities
saw Williams return to the Bay, where his factious
and impracticable views on civil policy,
quite as much or even more than any views on
theology, led to his subsequent banishment. The
later history of Williams was Massachusetts’ best
vindication. Charles Deane has thoroughly examined
his position as regards the patent, with
an amplitude of references, in the Mass<i>. Hist.

[An “Old Colony Historical Society,”
whose seat is at Taunton, began to publish
papers of a Collection in 1878. The local aspect
of the colony’s history is traced in various
town and parish histories, to which clews will
be found in F. B. Perkins’s <i>Check List of American
Local History</i>, Colburn’s <i>Massachusetts Bibliography</i>,
and in the historical sketch prefixed
to the <i>Plymouth County Atlas</i>, Boston, 1879.</p>
<p class="pfc4">These local histories usually contain more
or less genealogical information about the descendants
of the “first comers,” as those who
came in the first three vessels
(“Mayflower,” 180 tons, in
1620; “Fortune,” 55 tons, in
1621; “Ann,” 140 tons, and
“Little James,” 44 tons, 1623)
are distinctively called; and
various family histories have
also traced the spread of Pilgrim
blood throughout the
American States. Savage’s
<i>Geneal. Dict. of N. E.</i>, and
the bibliographies of American
genealogies by Whitmore
and Durrie, will indicate these.
Dr. N. B. Shurtleff published the long-accepted
list of the “Mayflower” passengers in the <i>N. E.
Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, i. 47 (also separately
privately printed); but several errors were corrected

Two parts of the territory were to be
divided among the patentees, and one third
was to be reserved for public uses; but the
entire territory was to be formed into counties,
baronies, hundreds, etc. From every county
and barony deputies were to be chosen to consult
upon the laws to be framed, and to reform
any notable abuses; yet these are not to be
assembled but by order of the President and
Council of New England, who are to give life
to the laws so to be made, as those to whom it
of right belongs. The counties and baronies
were to be governed by the chief and the officers
under him, with a power of high and low justice,&mdash;subject
to an appeal, in some cases, to
the supreme courts. The lords of counties
might also divide their counties into manors
and lordships, with courts for determining petty
matters. When great cities had grown up, they
were to be made bodies politic to govern their
own private affairs, with a right of representation
by deputies or burgesses. The management
of the whole affair was to be committed
to a general governor, to be assisted by the advice
and counsel of so many of the patentees as
should be there resident, together with the officers
of State. There was to be a marshal for matters
of arms; an admiral for maritime business,
civil and criminal; and a master of ordnance
for munition, etc. (Cf. the Council’s “Briefe
Relation,” in 2 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, ix. 21-25; S. F.

Tradition has preserved the name of “Winter
Harbor” there, and this name appears on a
map of the New England coast, which is one of
the collection known as Dudley’s <i>Arcano del
Mare</i>, issued at Florence in 1646,
and of which a reduced fac-simile is given herewith.
Dudley was an expatriated Englishman,
of the Earl of Leicester, and had a romantic
story, which has been told by Mr. Hale in the
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1873. Dudley’s first
wife had been a sister of Cavendish, and he is
otherwise connected with American exploration;
but there is no evidence that
he had much other material for this map than
Smith and the Dutch. [Dudley and his cartographical

Goche, treasurer, twenty-two. The average attendance

the said double shares, made up in little
bales of wax, and the names of twenty patentees
by whom these lots were to be drawn.” The

Buckingham, who had gone to Spain. There
were eleven members present, who drew for
themselves. Nine other lots were drawn for
absent members.</p>

grant to the Marquis, afterward Duke, of Hamilton
of land between the Connecticut River and
Narragansett, which lay dormant during his life,
was claimed by his heirs at the Restoration,
and at a later period, but was not allowed.
The grant to the Earl of Sterling, between St.
Croix and Sagadahoc, was in 1663 sold by his
heir to Lord Clarendon, and a charter for it was
granted next year to the Duke of York.</p>

At last, in 1696, what was termed “owning
the covenant” was first introduced into the
church at Hartford. Under the influence of the
synod held in Boston in 1662 of Massachusetts
churches alone, the “Half-Way Covenant” had
been adopted in that colony. A want of a closer
union among the churches was a growing feeling
in the colony of Connecticut not provided
for by the Cambridge Platform; and the Saybrook
Platform, the result of a Connecticut
synod held in 1708, was an attempt to provide
for this want. This ecclesiastical document was
printed in New London in 1710, in a small, thin
volume called a <i>Confession of Faith</i>, etc.; and
is the first book, says Isaiah Thomas, printed
in Connecticut. Trumbull, i. 471, 482.</p>

The name “Massachusetts,” so far as I
have observed, is first mentioned by Captain
Smith, in his <i>Description of New England</i>, 1616.
He spells the word variously, but he appears to
use the term “Massachuset” and “Massachewset”
to denote the country, while he adds a final
s when he is speaking of the inhabitants. He
speaks of “Massachusets Mount” and “Massachusets
River,” using the word also in its possessive
form; while in another place he calls the
former “the high mountain of Massachusit.”
To this mountain, on his map, he gives the English
name of “Chevyot Hills.” Hutchinson (i.
460) supposes the Blue Hills of Milton to be
intended. He says that a small hill near Squantum,
the former seat of a great Indian sachem,
was called Massachusetts Hill, or Mount Massachusetts,
down to his time. Cotton, in his Indian
vocabulary, says the word means “a hill in
the form of an arrow’s head.” See also Neal’s
<i>New England</i>, ii. 215, 216. In the Massachusetts
charter the name is spelled in three or four
different ways, to make sure of a description of
the territory. Cf. Letter of J. H. Trumbull, in
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct. 21, 1867, p. 77; and
<i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i. 37.</p>

[Dr. Palfrey (vol. iii. p. vii) has pointedly
condemned it, and the arrangement will be found
set forth in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
1848, p. 105. Besides much manuscript material
(not yet put into print) at the State House, and
in the Cabinet of the Historical Society, and the
usual local depositories, mention may be made
of some papers relating to New England recorded
in the <i>Sparks Catalogue</i>, p. 215; and the
numerous documents in the Egerton and other
manuscripts, in the British Museum, as brought
out in its printed <i>Catalogues of Manuscripts</i>, and
Colonel Chester’s list of manuscripts in the
Bodleian, in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xiv. 131. Mr.
S. L. M. Barlow, of New York, has an ancient
copy of the Records of the Massachusetts Company
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, iii. 36).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Brodhead’s prefaces to the published records
of New York indicated the sources of early
manuscript material in the different Government
offices of England, equally applicable to Massachusetts;
but these records have now been gathered
into the public Record Office, some account
of which will be found in Mr. B. F. Stevens’s
“Memorial,” <i>Senate, Miscellaneous Documents</i> no.
24, 47th Congress, 2d session, and in the <i>London
Quarterly</i>, April, 1871. It requires formality
and permission to examine these papers, only as
they are later than 1760. The calendaring and
printing of them, begun in 1855, is now going on;
and Mr. Hale has described (in the <i>Christian
Examiner</i>, May, 1861) the work as planned and
superintended by Mr. Sainsbury. Three of these
volumes already issued&mdash;<i>Calendar of State Papers,
Colonial America</i>, vol. i., 1574-1660; vol. v., 1661-1668;
vol. vii., 1669&mdash;are of much use to American
students. Mr. F. S. Thomas, Secretary of
the public Record Office, issued in 1849 a <i>History
of the State Paper Office and View of the
Documents therein Deposited</i>. Mr. C. W. Baird
described these depositories in London in the

[A list of the publications of this Society,
brought down, however, no later than 1868, will
be found in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xiv. 99; and
in 1871 Dr. S. A. Green issued a bibliography
of the Society, which was also printed in its <i>Proceedings</i>,
xii. 2. The first seven volumes of its
first series of <i>Collections</i> were early reprinted.
Each series of ten volumes has its own index.
The Society’s history is best gathered from its
own <i>Proceedings</i>, the publication of which was
begun in 1855; but two volumes have also been
printed, covering the earlier years 1791-1854.
The first of these dates marks the founding of
this the oldest historical society in this country.
Its founder, if one person can be so called, was
Dr. Jeremy Belknap, who was one of the earliest
who gave the writing of history in America a
reputable character. His <i>Life</i> has been written
by his granddaughter, Mrs. Jules Marcou, and
the book is reviewed by Francis Parkman in the
<i>Christian Examiner</i>, xliv. 78; cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, i. 117; iii. 285; ix. 12; xiv. 37. His historical
papers are described by C. C. Smith in
the <i>Unitarian Review</i>, vii. 604. The two principal
societies working parallel with it in part,
though professedly of wider scope, are the American
Antiquarian Society, at Worcester (not to
be confounded with the Worcester Society of
Antiquity,&mdash;a local antiquarian association),
and the New England Historic, Genealogical
Society, in Boston. The former has issued the
<i>Archæologia Americana</i> and <i>Proceedings</i> (cf. <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, xiv. 107); while the latter has
been the main support of the <i>New England Historical
and Genealogical Register</i>, which has published
an annual volume since 1847, and these
have contained various data for the history of
the Society. Cf. 1855, p. 10; 1859, p. 266; 1861,
preface; 1862, p. 203; 1863, preface; 1870, p.
225; 1876, p. 184, and reprinted as revised;
1879, preface, and p. 424, by E. B. Dearborn.
To these associations may be added the Essex
Institute, of Salem, the Connecticut Valley Historical
Society (begun in 1876), the Dorchester
Antiquarian Society, the Old Colony Historical
Society (cf. the chapter on the Pilgrims),&mdash;all
of which unite historical fellowship with publication,&mdash;and
the Prince Society, an organization
for publishing only, whose series of annotated
volumes relating to early Massachusetts history
is a valuable one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

It is a volume of great value, and brings
from $10 to $15 at sales. It is sometimes found
lettered on the back as vol. iii. of the <i>History</i>.
A third edition of the <i>History</i> was published in
Boston in 1795, with poor type and poor paper.
[A reprint of the <i>Papers</i> was made by the Prince
Society in 1865. For other papers of Hutchinson,
see 2 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, x., and 3 Ibid., i.; cf.
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1865, P. 187. A
controversy for many years existed between the
Historical Society and the State as to the custody
of a large mass of Hutchinson’s papers.
This can be followed in the Society’s <i>Proceedings</i>,
ii. 438; x. 118, 321; xi. 335; xii. 249; xiii.
130, 217; and in <i>Massachusetts Senate Documents</i>,

ii. 80-83. Of the map, Dr. Douglass says
(i. 362): “Dr. Cotton Mather’s map of New
England, New York, Jerseys, and Pennsylvania
is composed from some old rough drafts of the
first discoveries, with obsolete names not known
at this time, and has scarce any resemblance of
the country. It may be called a very erroneous,
antiquated map.” [See Editor’s note following
this chapter. For some notes on the Mather
Library, see <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, vol. i.
p. xviii. The annexed portrait of Mather resembles
the mezzotint, of which a reduced fac-simile
is given in the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i.
208, and which is marked <span class="smcap">Cottonus Matherus</span>,
<i>Ætatis suæ LXV</i>, MDCCXXVII. <i>P. Pelham
ad vivum pinxit ab origine fecit et excud.</i> Its
facial lines, however, are stronger and more
characteristic. It may be the reduction made
by Sarah Moorhead from the painting, thus
mentioned by Pelham, for the purpose of the
engraving. It is to be observed, however, that
the surroundings of the portrait are different in
the engraving. This same outline, but reversed,
characterizes a portrait of Mather, which belongs
to the American Antiquarian Society at
Worcester, and which is said to be by Pelham.

by S. G. Drake in his <i>Old Indian Chronicle</i> in
1836, and again in 1867, with new notes; and
no. 7 was reprinted in 1850 by Drake, and in
1865 by Woodward. Sabin, xiii. 321, 322.</p>
<p class="pfc4">These tracts are priced at twelve and eighteen
shillings, and at similarly high sums, even in
Rich’s catalogues of fifty years ago. Whenever
they have occurred in sales of late years they
have proved the occasion of much competition
and unusual prices. Cf. Stevens’s <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i.
1523, 1524.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another contemporary account by a Rhode
Island Quaker, as it is thought, John Easton,

the Causes which led to Philip’s War</i>. Cf. Palfrey,

[King Philip’s War, which was but the beginning
of a long series of wars which devastated
the frontiers, may be said properly to end
with the treaty of Casco, April 12, 1678, which
is preserved in the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i>;
though a continuation of hostilities intervened
till the treaty of Portsmouth, Sept. 8, 1685. Cf.

[Rich priced this book in 1832 (no. 375) at
£1 10<i>s.</i>,&mdash;an extraordinary high sum for those
days. I have seen the London edition priced
recently at £26, and $75; and the Boston edition
in the Menzies sale (no. 990) brought $200. It
was reprinted in New England at least six times
(all spurious editions) between 1775 and 1814
(<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, 5,523, etc.; <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, ii. 1,167, 1,168, 1,170); and S. G. Drake
brought out an annotated edition in two volumes
in 1865. Cf. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 252, 348; ii. 62.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Perhaps the most popular book touching the
events of the war was one which was not published
till 1716, from notes of Colonel Benjamin
Church, and compiled by that hero’s son, Thomas
Church, and called <i>Entertaining Passages relating
to Philip’s War</i>. It is an extremely scarce
book, and has brought $400. (<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>,
no. 383; Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>, no. 12,996;
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, iii. 293.) A second edition,
Newport, 1772, is said to have been edited
by Dr. Stiles, but it is not supposed he was privy
to the fraud practised in that edition of presenting
an engraving of the portrait of Charles
Churchill, the English poet, with the addition
of a powder-horn slung over the shoulder, as a
likeness of Church. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xix. 243; also iii. 293; and <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, December,
1868, pp. 27, 271.) Drake first reissued
it in 1827, and made stereotype plates
of the book, and they have been much used
since. He continued to use the spurious portrait
as late as 1857. Sabin, iv. 12,996; Brinley,
no. 5,514. Dr. H. M. Dexter did all that
is necessary for the text in his edition (two
volumes) in 1865-67. Another class of books
growing out of the war during its long continuance,
particularly at the eastward, is what collectors
know as “captivities,” the most famous
of which is, perhaps, that of Mrs. Rowlandson,
of Lancaster, printed in 1682. The <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>,
nos. 469, 5,540, etc., groups them, and they
are scattered through Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>.
The <i>Brinley Catalogue</i> also groups the
works on the Indian wars of New England (nos.
382, etc.); and a condensed exposition of the
authorities on Philip’s War will be found in the
<i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, i. 327. The local
aspects of the war involve a very large amount of
citation and reference. What are known as the
“Narragansett Townships” grew out of the war.
Before the troops marched from Dedham Plain,
Dec. 9, 1675, they were promised “a gratuity of
land beside their wages,” and not till 1737 were
the promises fulfilled, when 840 claimants or
their representatives met on Boston Common,
and dividing themselves into seven groups, they
took possession of seven townships in Maine,
Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, granted
by the General Court. <i>New England Historical

“Maine” took its name probably from the
early designation, by the sailors and fishermen,
of the main land&mdash;that is, “the main,”&mdash;in
distinction from the numerous islands on the
coast. See Weymouth’s “Voyage,” in 3 <i>Mass.

Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, i. 371. The earliest use of the
name, officially employed, that I have met with,
is in the grant to Gorges and Mason of Aug.
10, 1622, which recites that the patentees, “by
consent of the President and Council, intend to
name it the <i>Province of Maine</i>.” See the <i>Popham
Memorial Volume</i>, p. 122. This grant was never
made use of, but the name was inserted in the
royal charter to Gorges of April 3, 1639, which
secured its future use. Sullivan’s <i>Maine</i>, Appendix,
399. The territory had been previously
included in the European designations of Baccalaos
and Norumbega. The Indian name was
Mavooshen. See Purchas, iv., 1873; <i>Maine Hist.

Mason’s will, or a long extract from it,
may be seen in Hazard, i. 397-399, dated Nov. 26,
1635; also in <i>Provincial Papers</i>. These papers
last named are a publication of the State. The
Rev. Dr. Nathaniel Bouton, between 1867 and
1876, completed ten volumes of Papers. They
contain nothing before 1631; few from 1631
to 1686. Most of the original papers between
1641 and 1679 are in the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i>.
The papers of interest in the present connection
are in vols. i. and ii. The series has since been
resumed under another editor, with the publication
(1882) of the first part (A to F) of documents
relating to towns, 1680-1800. Very few
of the papers, however, are before 1700. Colonel
A. H. Hoyt’s “Notes, Historical and Bibliographical,
on the Laws of New Hampshire,”
are in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1876. Like
most of the patents issued at the grand division,
Mason’s grant included ten thousand acres more
of land on the southeast part of Sagadahoc,
“from henceforth to be called by the name of
Massonia.”</p>

Trumbull, i. 28, from manuscripts of President
Clap. This old Connecticut patent has
always been a mystery. Some of the colonists
of the Winthrop emigration to Massachusetts in
1630 were unfavorably impressed on their arrival
with the place selected for a plantation. The
sad mortality of the preceding winter was appalling,
and they began to cast their thoughts on a
more southerly spot than Massachusetts Bay.
In a letter of John Humfrey, written from
London, Dec. 9, 1636, in reply to one just received
from his brother-in-law, Isaac Johnson,
from the colony, he says, in speaking of Mr.
Downing: “He is the only man for Council
that is heartily ours in the town; and yet, unless
you settle upon a good river and in a less snowy
and cold place, I can see no great edge on him to
come unto us.” Further on he says, “My Lord
of Warwick will take a patent of that place you
writ of for himself, and so we may be bold to do
there as if it were our own.” (4 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,
vi. 3, 4.) No further hint is given as to the location
of Warwick’s intended grant, and we have
no contemporaneous record of any patent having
been taken by him at this time or later. The
Earl was a great friend of the Puritans. It was
through him that the Massachusetts patent was
obtained; and the patent to the people of Plymouth
was signed by him alone, but in the name
of the Council, and sealed with their seal.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The title to Connecticut was contested. On
the grand division of 1635, James, Marquis,
afterward Duke, of Hamilton, received for
his share the territory between the Connecticut
and Narragansett rivers, and a copy of his
feoffment was cited by Chalmers, as on record
bearing date April 22, 1635, that being the date
which all the grants of that final division bore.
From a copy on the Connecticut files Mr. R. R.
Hinman, Secretary of State, published the deed
in a volume of ancient documents, at Hartford,
in 1836. On the Restoration the heirs of the
Duke, in a petition to the King, asked to “be
restored to their just right,” and their claim was,
in 1664, laid by the King’s commissioners before
the Connecticut authorities. These in their answer
set up, in the first place, the prior grant of
Lord Say and Sele and others, which Connecticut,
as they alleged, had “purchased at a dear
rate,” and which had been recently ratified and
confirmed by the King in their new charter; then,
secondly, a conquest from the natives; and,
thirdly, they claimed thirty years’ peaceable possession
(Trumbull, i. 524, 530). At a period
still later, the Earl of Arran, a grandson, applied
to King William for a hearing; and when in a
formal manner several patents were exhibited
on the part of Connecticut, the Earl’s final reply
was, “that when they produced a grant from the
Plymouth Council to the Earl of Warwick, it
should have an answer.” (Chalmers, pp. 299-301;
Trumbull, i. 524.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">Some entries in the recently recovered records
of the Council for New England tend to deepen
the suspicion that the Earl of Warwick never received
the alleged grant from that body. It is
true that the records as preserved are not entire,
and do not cover the year 1630, and for the year
1631 they begin at November 4. But some later
entries are very significant. Under date of June
21, 1632, which is three months after the date
of the grant to Lord Say and Sele and associates,
is this entry: “The Secretary is to bring,
against the next meeting, a rough draft in paper
of a patent for the E. of Warwick, from the
river of the Narrigants 10 leagues westward.
Sir Ferd. Gorges will forthwith give particular
directions for the said patent.” At the next
meeting, June 26, “The rough draft of a patent
for the E. of Warwick was now read. His
Lordship, upon hearing the same, gave order
that the grant should be unto Rob. Lord Rich
and his associates, A, B, etc. And it was agreed
by the Council that the limits of the said patent
should be 30 English miles westward, and 50
miles into the land northward, provided that it
did not prejudice any other patent formerly
granted.” A committee was appointed to take
further order respecting this patent, and there is
no evidence that it was ever perfected or issued.
This proposed grant, it will be seen, covered in
part the same territory previously included in
the grant above cited to Lord Say, Lord Brook,
Lord Rich, and others by the Earl of Warwick
himself.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Three days afterward some very singular
orders were adopted by the Council, indicating
that there had been a serious disagreement with
the Earl, or that a feeling akin to suspicion, of
which the Earl was the object, had found a lodgment
in that body. The Earl being president,
the meetings for some years had been held at
“Warwick House in Holborne.” At a meeting
on the 29th of June, at which the Earl was
not present, “It was agreed that the E. of
Warwick should be entreated to direct a course
for finding out what patents have been granted
for New England.” (Did not the Council keep
a record of their grants?) Also, “The Lord
Great Chamberlain and the rest of the Council
now present sent their clerk unto the E. of
Warwick for the Council’s great seal, it being
in his Lordship’s keeping.” Answer was
brought that as soon as his man Williams
came in he would send it. It was then voted
that the meetings of the Council, which for
some time, as I have already said, had been
held at Warwick House, should hereafter be
held at Captain Mason’s House, in Fenchurch
Street. But the seal was not then sent, and during
the next five months two other formal applications
were made for it. In the mean time and
thence after the records indicate the Earl’s absence
from the meetings, and finally Lord Gorges
was chosen President of the Council in his place.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The patent to Lord Say and Sele, it may be
added, was never formally transferred to Connecticut.
In the agreement of 1644/45 Fenwick
conveyed the fort and lands on the river, and
promised to convey the jurisdiction of all the
lands between Narragansett River and Saybrook
Fort, “if it come into his power,”&mdash;which he
seems never to have done, though the authorities
of Connecticut claimed that they had paid
him for it. For a long time the Connecticut
authorities appear to have had no copy of this
patent, for they were often challenged to exhibit
it, and were not able to do so; though they say
that a copy was shown to the commissioners
when the confederation of the colonies was
formed,&mdash;then of course in the possession of
Fenwick; and in 1648 it is referred to as having
been recently seen. (Hazard, ii. 120, 123.)
A transcript of this patent was found in London
by John Winthrop, among the papers of Governor
Hopkins, who died there in 1658. See <i>Connecticut
Colonial Records</i>, pp. 268, 568, 573, 574.</p>

Vol. i. pp. 77-80, 509-563, 1-384. The
twelve Capital Laws of the Connecticut Colony,
established in 1642, were taken almost literally
from the Body of Liberties of Massachusetts, established
in 1641. The preamble to the code of
1650, the paragraph following it, and many, if not
all, of the laws were taken from the Massachusetts
Book of Laws published in 1649. A copy
of the constitution of 1639 was prefixed to
the Code. This was first printed in a small
volume in 1822 at Hartford, by Silas Andrus,
called <i>The Code of 1650, being a Compilation of
the Earliest Laws and Orders of the General Court
of Connecticut; also, the Constitution, or Civil
Compact, entered into and adopted by the Towns
of Windsor, Hartford, and Weathersfield, in 1638-39,
to which is added some Extracts from the
Laws and Judicial Proceedings of New Haven

A copy of the original edition is also in the
Library of the Boston Athenæum, not quite perfect.
Two copies were in the sale of Mr. Brinley’s
library in 1879, and they brought, one $380,
the other, not perfect, $310. Dr. J. Hammond
Trumbull, in his learned Introduction to his edition
of <i>The True-Blue Laws of Connecticut and
New Haven, and the False Blue Laws Invented by
the Rev. Samuel Peters</i>, etc., Hartford, 1876, says:
“Just when or by whom the acts and proceedings
of New Haven Colony were first stigmatized
as <i>Blue Laws</i> cannot now be ascertained. The
presumption, however, is strong that the name
had its origin in New York, and that it gained
currency in Connecticut among Episcopalian and
other dissenters from the established church,
between 1720 and 1750” (p. 24). He thinks
that “blue” was a convenient epithet for whatever
“in colonial laws and proceedings looked
over-strict, or queer, or ‘puritanic’” (pp. 24, 27).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mr. Peters, of course, did not invent the
name. He says of these laws: “They consist of
a vast multitude, and were very properly termed
<i>Blue Laws</i>, i.e., <i>bloody laws</i>.” In his <i>General
History of Connecticut</i>, London, 1781, Peters
gives some forty-five of these laws as a sample of
the whole, “denominated <i>blue laws</i> by the neighboring
colonies,” which “were never suffered
to be printed.” The greater part of these probably
never had an existence as standing laws or
otherwise. The archives of the colony fail to
reveal such, though we do not forget that the
jurisdiction records for nine years are lost.
Peters’ laws have often been reprinted, and appear
in Mr. Trumbull’s volume above cited,
along with authentic documents relating to the
foundation of Connecticut and New Haven colonies,
already referred to in this paper. (See
Peters’ <i>Connecticut</i>, pp. 63, 66; the <i>New-Englander</i>,
April, 1871, art. “Blue Laws;” and
<i>Methodist Quarterly Review</i>, January, 1878.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">It might be inferred from the conclusion of
the titlepage (cited above) of the small volume
published by Silas Andrus, at Hartford, in 1822,
on bluish paper, bound in blue covers, with
a frontispiece representing a constable seizing
a tobacco taker, which was stereotyped and
subsequently issued at different dates, that the
book contained the Peters’ laws; but what related
to New Haven here were simply extracts
of a few laws and court orders from the records.
The Blue Laws of Peters were reprinted
by J. W. Barber, in his <i>History and Antiquities
of New Haven</i>, 1831, with a note in which the
old story is repeated, that the term blue originated
from the color of the paper in which the
first printed laws were stitched. They were also
printed by Mr. Hinman, formerly Secretary of
the State of Connecticut, in 1838, in a volume
already cited, along with other valuable documents
relating to the colony, and with what he
called the Blue Laws of Virginia, of Barbadoes,
of Maryland, New York, South Carolina, Massachusetts,
and Plymouth.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Peters’ <i>Connecticut</i> (1781) is now a scarce
book. The copy in the Menzies sale, no. 1,590,
brought $125. Cf. <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 2,088,
etc. The interest in this apocryphal history of
Connecticut and in Peters’ Blue Laws was revived
in modern times by the publication in
1829 of a new edition of Peters’ <i>History</i>, in
12º., at New Haven, with a preface and eighty-seven
pages of supplementary notes. The anonymous
editor of the new edition was Sherman
Croswell, son of the Rev. Harry Croswell,&mdash;a
recent graduate of Yale College, who furnished
the supplementary notes. Nearly all the type of
this edition was set by the late Joel Munsell,
then a young man just twenty-one years of age.
Mr. Croswell subsequently went to Albany as
co-editor with his cousin, Edwin Croswell, of
the <i>Albany Argus</i>. (Joel Munsell, <i>Manuscript
Note</i>; October, 1871.) Professor Franklin B.
Dexter, of Yale College, writes me under date
of Feb. 20, 1883, respecting the enterprise of
publishing the new edition of Peters’ <i>History</i>:
“I have heard that the publisher, Dorus Clarke,
used to say that he lost $2,000 by the publication.
Sherman Croswell was a young lawyer
then living here, a son of the Rev. Dr. Harry
Croswell, and brother and classmate (Yale College,
1822) of the more gifted Rev. William
Croswell, of the Church of the Advent in
Boston. Sherman was born Nov. 10, 1802; removed
to Albany in 1831, and became an editor
of the <i>Argus</i> with his cousin, Edwin Croswell;
returned to New Haven in 1855, and died here
March 4, 1859. I have repeatedly heard that he
edited this publication, though my authority has
never been a very definite one. Munsell’s note I
should not hesitate to accept as far as this fact
is concerned.” Munsell inadvertently calls Sherman
Croswell a brother of Edwin. A spurious
edition of this book was published in New York
in 1877, edited by a descendant of the author,
S. J. McCormick. Cf. <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>,
Oct. 22, 1877, and <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
1877, p. 238.</p>
<p class="pfc4">But New Haven was not the only New England
colony whose laws were satirized or burlesqued
by those who did not sympathize with
the strict ways of the Puritan. John Josselyn,
who visited the Massachusetts Colony twice, in
his account of the country published in 1674
professes to give some of the laws of that colony.
Some of those cited by him are true, and some
are false. Some were court orders or sentences
for crimes. One is similar to a law in Peters’
code: “For kissing a woman in the street, though
in the way of civil salute, whipping or a fine”
(p. 178). Of course there were at an early period
in the colony instances of ridiculous punishments
awarded at the sole discretion of the magistrate,
of which the record in all cases may not be preserved,
and it is hazardous to deny, for that
reason, that they ever took place. The existence
of standing laws are more easily ascertained.
Josselyn (p. 179) refers the reader to
“their Laws in print.” During his second visit
to Massachusetts (1663-1671) he could have
seen the digest of 1649, and that of 1660. Of
the first no copy is now extant, but the Connecticut
code of 1650, first printed in 1822, was
perhaps substantially a transcript of it. 3 <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i> viii. 214. Josselyn probably never
examined either of the Massachusetts digests.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The notorious Edward Ward published, in
1699 a folio of sixteen pages, entitled <i>A Trip
to New England</i>, etc. (Carter-Brown, ii. 1580.)
A large part of it, where he speaks of “Boston
and the Inhabitants,” is abusive and scandalous.
He enlarges upon Josselyn in the instance cited,
whose book he had seen. Mr. Drake and Dr.
Shurtleff, in their histories of Boston, both quote
from it. No one would think of believing “Ned
Ward,” the editor of the <i>London Spy</i>, who was
sentenced more than once to stand in the pillory
for his scurrility; yet for all this he probably
was as truthful, if not as pious, as Parson Peters
of a later generation.</p>

The official name of this State since 1663
is “Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.”
The Island of “Aquedneck,” its Indian name,
spelled in various ways, was so called till 1644,
when the Court ordered that henceforth it be
“called the Isle of Rhodes, or Rhode Island.”
It is said that Block, the Dutch navigator, in
1614, gave the island the name of “Roodt
Eylandt,” from the prevalence of red clay in
some portions of its shores. There are traditions
connecting the name with Verrazano and
the Isle of Rhodes in Asia Minor, which require
no further mention. See Arnold’s <i>Rhode Island</i>,

very excellent advice as to the course to be followed

On this point, see Father Foley’s <i>Records</i>,
just mentioned, and “A Missing Page of Catholic
American History,&mdash;New Jersey colonized
by Catholics,” by the Rev. R. L. Burtsell, D.D.,
in the <i>Catholic World</i> for November, 1880 (xxxii.
204 <i>et seq.</i>, New York, 1881). Sir Edmund Plowden
was not so stanch in his adherence to his
faith as was his illustrious grandfather, for in
1635 he is said (temporarily, at least) to have
counterfeited conformity in religion. See “Sir
Edmund Plowden in the Fleet,” by the Rev. Edward
D. Neill, in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i>, v.
424 <i>et seq.</i>, an article which “furnishes some
facts relative to the career of Sir Edmund
Plowden just before he left England for Virginia,”
from “the calendars of British State
papers during the reign of Charles the First.”</p>

See “Sir Edmund Plowden or Ployden,”
by “Albion,” in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, iv. 319 <i>et seq.</i>

not elsewhere met with as to have provoked a
series of pertinent queries from the late Sebastian
F. Streeter, Secretary of the Maryland Historical
Society, Ibid., ix. 301-2 (London, 1854),

The petitions and warrant mentioned, with
a paper entitled “The Commodities of the Island
called Manati ore Long Isle within the Continent
of Virginia,” extracted from Strafford’s <i>Letters
and Despatches</i> (i. 72) and <i>Colonial Papers</i> (vol. vi.
nos. 60, 61), in the Public Record Office at London,
are given in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1869, pp. 213
<i>et seq.</i> (New York, 1870). “Between this period
and 1634,” according to “Albion,” “Sir Edmund
was engaged in fulfilling the conditions of the
warrant by carrying out the colonization by indentures,
which were executed and enrolled in
Dublin, and St. Mary’s, in Maryland, in America.
In Dublin the parties were Viscount
Muskerry, 100 planters; Lord Monson, 100
planters; Sir Thomas Denby, 100 planters;
Captain Clayborne (of American notoriety),
50; Captain Balls; and amounting in all to
540 colonizers, beside others in Maryland, Virginia,
and New England.” The same persons,
with “Lord Sherrard” and “Mr. Heltonhead”
and his brother, are named as lessees under the
charter of New Albion, in Varlo’s <i>Floating Ideas
of Nature</i>, ii. 13, hereafter spoken of.</p>

“Confirmed,” says “Albion,” “24th July,
1634.” The Latin original of this charter may
be seen in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i>, vol. vii.

32 pp. (Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. v. no. 19,724.) On
the <i>verso</i> of the titlepage (reproduced here from
the copy of the book in the Philadelphia Library)
appear: “The Order, Medall, and Riban
of the Albion Knights, of the Conversion of
23 Kings, their support;” the medal (given
also in Mickle’s <i>Reminiscences of Old Gloucester</i>)
bearing on its face a coroneted effigy of Sir
Edmund Plowden, surrounded by the legend,
‘<span class="smcap">Edmundus. Comes. Palatinus. et. Guber.
N. Albion</span>,’ and on the reverse two coats of
arms impaled; the dexter, those of the Province
of New Albion, namely, the open Gospel, surmounted
by a hand dexter issuing from the partiline
grasping a sword erect, surmounted by a
crown; the sinister, those of Plowden himself, a
<i>fesse dancettée</i> with two <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> on the upper
points; supporters, two bucks rampant gorged
with crowns,&mdash;the whole surmounted by the
coronet of an Earl Palatine, and encircled with
the motto, ‘<span class="smcap">Sic suos Virtus beat</span>;’ and the
order consisting of this achievement encircled
by twenty-two heads couped and crowned, held
up by a crowned savage kneeling,&mdash;the whole
surrounded with the legend, ‘<span class="smcap">Docebo iniquos
vias tuas, et impii ad te convertentur</span>.’
These engravings are accompanied by Latin
mottoes and English verses on “Ployden” and
“Albion’s Arms.” The work is the subject of
an essay entitled “An Examination of Beauchamp
Plantagenet’s Description of the Province
of New Albion,” by John Penington, in the
<i>Memoirs of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>,
vol. iv. pt. i. pp. 133 <i>et seq.</i> (Philadelphia, 1840),
for which the writer is very justly censured by a
reviewer in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for August,
1840, in these terms: “He has shown himself
not unskilful in throwing ridicule upon the
exaggerations and falsifications with which (as
unhappily has been generally the case with such
compositions in all ages) the prospectus of Ployden,
or Plowden, abounds; but he has failed in
the more difficult task of separating truth from
falsehood.” The same critic says: “It is clear
to us that the pamphlet was issued with the consent,
and probably at the procuration and
charges, of Sir Edmund Ployden;” and he attempts
to throw some light upon the personality
of the author, whose name of “Plantagenet,”
undoubtedly, is fictitious. Besides the copy of
the <i>Description of New Albion</i> in the Philadelphia
Library, there is another in the Carter-Brown Library
(<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. ii. no. 649), at Providence;
three are mentioned by Mr. Penington as included
in private libraries; and two, says the
writer in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, are preserved
in the British Museum. The book was reprinted
from the Philadelphia copy in <i>Tracts and Other
Papers</i> collected by Peter Force, vol. ii. no. 7
(Washington, 1838), and again reprinted from
Force in Scull’s <i>Evelyns in America</i>, p. 67 <i>et
seq.</i> The citations in the text are taken directly
from the Philadelphia and Carter-Brown copies,
which will account for some variations from
these occasionally inaccurate reprints. A second
edition of the original is mentioned by
Lowndes as published in 1650. See the <i>Huth
Catalogue</i>, which says: “The original edition
was doubtless published at Middleburgh in
1641 or 1642.”</p>

An intimacy which authorized Plantagenet
to speak thus of the Earl Palatine: “I found his
conversation as sweet and winning, as grave and
sober, adorned with
much Learning, enriched
with sixe
Languages, most
grounded and experienced
in forain
matters of State policy,
and government,
trade, and sea
voyages, by 4 years
travell in Germany,
France, Italy, and
Belgium, by 5 years
living an Officer in
Ireland, and this
last 7 years in America.”
“Sir Edmund
Plowden,” says “Albion,” “was not inferior to
any of his co-governors in ability, fortune, position,
or family.”</p>

to Plantagenet, “The bounds is a thousand
miles compasse, of this most temperate, rich
Province, for our South bound is Maryland
North bounds, and beginneth at Aquats or the
Southermost or first Cape of Delaware Bay in
thirty-eight and forty minutes, and so runneth
by, or through, or including Kent Isle, through
Chisapeack Bay to Pascatway, including the fals
of Pawtomecke river to the head or Northermost

limits of New Albion, as given in Smith’s <i>History
of New Jersey</i>, are cited by the Rev. William
Smith, D.D., in <i>An Examination of the

name the region on the west side of the Delaware
south of the Schuylkill “Aromaninck,”
which was understood by Mr. Neill to be the
“Eriwomeck” of Yong and Evelin, placed,
therefore, at that point by him in articles in the

is given on another map, one of Visscher’s
(from which these in Speed’s work were partly
derived), agreeing with several of the period in
assigning “Ermomex” (quite as likely the true
“Eriwomeck”) to the eastern side of the Delaware.

As early as 1658 Josiah Coale and Thomas
Thurston visited the Susquehanna Indians.
They were received with great kindness, and
spent some weeks with the red men, travelling
over two hundred miles in their company.
Coale also visited the tribes of Martha’s Vineyard
and others of Massachusetts. He returned
to them after being liberated from prison at Sandwich,
and was told by a chief: “The Englishmen
do not love Quakers, but the Quakers are honest
men and do no harm; and this is no Englishman’s
sea or land, and the Quakers shall come
here and welcome.” Of this early teacher Penn
wrote: “Therefore shall his memorial remain
as a sweet oyntment with the Righteous, and
time shall never blot him out of their remembrance.”
Fox had several meetings with the
Indians, and at one he says, “They sat very
grave and sober, and were all very attentive,
beyond many called Christians.” After Fox’s
return to England, his interest in the Indians
continued, and in 1681 he wrote to the Burlington
Meeting to invite the Indians to worship
with them. It was thus that the way was prepared
for the peaceful settlement of West Jersey
and Pennsylvania.</p>

The courts were of three different kinds:
namely, the County Courts, Orphans’ Courts, and
Provincial Court. The County Courts sat at
irregular intervals during the year, and were
composed of justices of the peace, commissioned
from time to time, the number of whom varied
with the locality, the press of business, or the
caprice of the government. They had jurisdiction
to try criminal offences of inferior grades,
and all civil causes except where the title to land
was in controversy. In proper cases they exercised
a distinct equity jurisdiction, which seems,
however, to have been excessively irritating to the
people. In many instances they were materially
assisted in their labors by boards of peacemakers,
who were annually appointed to settle controversies,
and who performed pretty nearly the same
functions as modern arbitrators. The Justices
of the County Courts sat also in the Orphans’
Courts, which were established in every county
to control and distribute the estates of decedents.
For some cause now imperfectly understood, the
conduct of the early Orphans’ Courts was exceedingly
unsatisfactory, and their practice so
irregular that but little can be gleaned respecting
them.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Provincial Court, which was established
in 1684, was composed of five, afterwards of
three, judges, who were always among the most
considerable men in the province. They had
jurisdiction in cases of heinous or enormous
crimes, and also in all cases where the title to
land was in controversy. An appeal also lay to
this court from the County and Orphans’ Courts,
in all cases where it was thought that injustice
had been done.</p>

In 1700 the admiralty jurisdiction was done away with by the establishment of a regular vice-admiralty
court in the province.</p>

This must not be confused with the present
Cape Henlopen, which was in 1760 called Cape
Cornelius. The line was eventually run from a
point known as “The False Cape,” about twenty-three
or twenty-four miles south of the present
Cape Henlopen.</p>

While in America, Penn made other purchases
from the Indians. One purchase from
the Five Nations for land on the Susquehanna
was delayed until after the limits between Pennsylvania
and Maryland were settled, when it
was consummated in 1696, through the agency of
Governor Dongan of New York, and confirmed
by the Indians in 1701.</p>

[There is a contemporary map showing the
laying out of Philadelphia by Holme (concerning
which much will be found in John Reed’s
<i>Explanation of the Map of Philadelphia</i>, 1774),
and also a part of Harris’s map of Pennsylvania,
which gives the location of Pennsbury Manor,
Penn’s country house, in Bucks County, four
miles above Bristol, on the Delaware, which
was built during Penn’s first visit, on land purchased
by Markham of the Indians. See the

Their frames were logs; they were thirty
feet long and eighteen wide, with a partition in
the middle forming two rooms, one of which
could be again divided. They were covered
with clapboards, which were “rived feather-edged.”
They were lined and filled in. The
floor of the lower rooms was the ground; that
of the upper was of clapboards. These houses,
he said, would last ten years; but some persons,
even in the villages, had built much better. The
house built for James Claypoole was about such
as we have described. It had, however, a good
cellar, but no chimney. He said it looked like
a barn.</p>

It is worth while to make record of two
tracts of this early period whose titles might
deceive the student with the belief that they pertained
to the subject, but they do not. The
first is a burlesque indorsement of the Protestant
Reconciler, entitled <i>Three Letters of Thanks
to the Protestant Reconciler</i>: <i>1. From the Anabaptists
at Munster; 2. From the Congregations
in New England; 3. From the Quakers in Pennsylvania.</i>
London: Benjamin Took, 1683, 4º,
26 pp.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The other is a Letter to <i>William Penn, with
His Answer</i>, London, 1688, 4º, 10 pp; again
the same year in 20 pp.; and in Dutch, 16 pp.,
Amsterdam, 1689.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This letter, by Sir William Popple, is addressed
“To the Honourable William Penn,
Esq., Proprietor and Governor of Pennsylvania.”
It is a friendly criticism on his conduct while
living in England, after his return from America.
It has nothing to do with his province but
is of a biographical nature. Proud prints the
correspondence in his <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>
(i. 314). It has been catalogued as connected
with the history of the province. Cf. <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, vol. ii., nos. 1,363 and 1,390.
Both of the London editions are in the possession
of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The student may also need to be warned
against a forged letter of Cotton Mather, about
a plot to capture Penn. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
1870, p. 329.</p>

It may not, however, be out of place to
mention here the chief reasons on which the
followers of Fox base their objections to the
manner in which it is customary to speak of
the first Quakers who visited New England. It
is generally represented that it was the behavior
of these early ministers which caused their persecution;
but before a European Quaker had
set foot on Massachusetts the court had denounced
them, and in October, 1656, a law was
passed which spoke of them as a “cursed sect of
heretickes.” It is also customary to speak of the
executions of Quakers in Boston in connection
with certain acts of indecency committed by
women who were either laboring under mental
aberrations or believed that they were fulfilling
a divine command, leaving on the mind of the
reader the impression that the capital law was
called into existence to correct such abuses.
No such acts were committed until after the
capital law had fallen into disuse. Nor is it
clear, from printed authorities, that the death
penalty was only inflicted after every possible
means had been tried by the Massachusetts
authorities to rid themselves of their unwelcome
visitors. The language of the law of
1658, which declared that if a banished Quaker
returned he or she should suffer death, does not
show that it supplemented that of 1657, by which
punishments increasing in severity were visited
on Quakers upon their first, second, and third
return. Neither will the practice under the law
of 1658 justify this interpretation. The penalties
of the law of 1657 had not been exhausted
in the cases of Mary Dyer, William Robinson,
Marmaduke Stevenson, and William Ledera,
when they were hanged.</p>

Mr. Whitehead informs me that the papers
in the Library of the New Jersey Historical
Society consist of 17 parts (no. 10 missing),
and are called, “The History of the Colonies
of New Jersey and Pennsylvania in America.
From the time of their first discovery to the
year 1721. Together with an Appendix containing
several occurrences that have happened
since, down to the present time. Undertaken
at the desire of the Yearly Meeting of the
people called Quakers, of the said Colonies,
and published by their order. By&mdash;&mdash;. Psal.
cv. 12. 13. 14, when they were but a few, etc.”
Several of the passages, marked “Transfer to
History of Friends,” correspond to the Philadelphia
manuscript, which is apparently the
portion designated as the second part in the
author’s scheme, as thus detailed by himself in
the New Jersey manuscript: “The History of
the Province of Pennsylvania in two parts.
Part I. The time and manner of the grants of
territories, the arrival of settlers, a general
view of the original state of the country and
of the public proceedings in legislation, and
other matters for the first forty years after the
settlement made under William Penn. Part II.
The introduction and some account of the religious
progress of the people called Quakers
therein, including the like account respecting
the same people in New Jersey as constituting
one Yearly Meeting.”</p>

The first ten volumes of the series known
as the <i>Colonial Records</i> bear the title of <i>Minutes
of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania, from
the Organization</i> [1683] <i>to the Termination of the
Proprietary Government</i>; the last six: <i>Minutes
of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania
from its Organization to the Termination of the
Revolution</i>. They contain, however, the Minutes
down to 1790. The publication of this series
was begun by the State in 1837, the American
Philosophical Society and the Historical Society
of Pennsylvania having petitioned the Legislature
to adopt measures for this end. After three
volumes were issued (Harrisburg, 1838-1840)
the publication was suspended. In 1851, at the
request of the Historical Society, the matter was
again brought before the Legislature by Edward
Armstrong, Esq., a member of the Society, then
a delegate to the Legislature. The sixteen volumes
of the <i>Colonial Records</i> and twelve of the
<i>Pennsylvania Archives</i> were issued between the
years 1852 and 1856. The volumes issued in
1838-1840 were reprinted in 1852, and an index
volume to both works in 1860. The latter does
not apply to the volume of the Records published
in 1838-1840.</p>

B contains Historical Notes of the Early

are valuable pieces of work; but we do not agree
with Mr. Nead that the laws printed and agreed
upon in England, and the written ones prepared
by Penn and submitted to the Assembly that
met at Upland, December, 1682, were both
passed. The passage in Penn’s letter of Dec.
16, 1682, which reads, “the laws were agreed
upon more fully worded,” indicates that the
printed series was superseded by the written
one.</p>

That no doubt should exist regarding the
accuracy of these dates, we have had Penn’s letter
to the Lords of Plantation in the State-Paper
Office, London, examined, and in it the 24th is
clearly written. This is confirmed by the original
draft of his letter to the Free Society of
Traders, in which the same date of arrival is
given. The “New Castle County old Records
transcribed,” quoted by Hazard, give the 27th
as the time of his arrival before that town, and
the 28th as the day on which he took official
possession. These statements are verified by
the Breviate of Penn vs. Lord Baltimore, in which
the original Newcastle Records appear to have
been quoted, since the volumes and folios referred
to differ from those given by Hazard.</p>

This conclusion has been reached by examining
the evidence we have in strict chronological
order. There is nothing to show that Penn met
the Indians in council until May, 1683. At this
conference the Indians either failed to understand
him, or refused to sell him land. His next
meeting with them was on June 23, 1683. He
then purchased land from them, and the promises
of friendship quoted on a former page
were exchanged. It is a significant fact that
while there is scarcely any allusion to the Indians
in his letters prior to the meeting of June 23,
subsequent to that time they are full of descriptions
of them, and of accounts of his intercourse
with them.</p>

[The elm-tree known as the Treaty-tree
which was long venerated as the one under
which the interview was held, was blown down
in 1810, and a picture of it taken in 1809 is preserved
in the Historical Society. (Cf. <i>Catalogue
of Paintings, etc., belonging to the Historical Society</i>,
no. 167. Cf. views in Gay’s <i>Popular History
of the United States</i>, ii. 493; Watson’s <i>Annals

last century in <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>,
iv. 186.) For the monument on the spot, see
Lossing’s <i>Field Book of the Revolution</i>, ii. 254.
It is well known that Benjamin West made the
scene of the treaty the subject of a large historical
painting. The original first deed given by
the Indians to Markham is in the possession of
the Historical Society. Cf. <i>Catalogue of Paintings,
etc., belonging to the Historical Society</i>,

At a session of the Assembly held in Januuary,
1648, an incident occurred which annalists
have generally deemed worthy of mention as the
first instance of a demand of political rights for
women. Miss Margaret Brent&mdash;who was the
administratix of Governor Calvert, and as such
held to be the attorney, in fact, of Lord Baltimore&mdash;applied
to the Assembly to have a vote in
the House for herself, and another as his lordship’s
attorney.</p>

reprinted it as stated in the text, following,
however, the original McSherry transcript,

There is a fine portrait of the first Lord
Baltimore in the gallery of the Earl of Verulam
at Glastonbury, England. It was painted by
Mytens, court painter to James I. An engraving
from it is in the possession of the Maryland
Historical Society. In 1882 a copy of this portrait
was presented to the State of Maryland by
John W. Garrett, Esq. It is engraved in McSherry’s
<i>Maryland</i>, p. 21, as from an original in
the great gallery of Sir Francis Bacon; and again
in S. H. Gay’s <i>Popular History of the United
States</i>, i. 485. An engraved portrait of Cecilius,
second Lord Baltimore, at the age of fifty-one,
made by Blotling, in 1657, is in the possession of
the Maryland Historical Society. Engravings
of these portraits of the two lords are given in
the present chapter.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Baltimore arms are those of Calverts,
quartered with Crosslands. The Calvert arms
are barry of six, or and sable, over all a
bend counterchanged. Crosslands: quarterly,
argent and gules, over all a cross bottony counterchanged.
Lord Baltimore used: quarterly,
first and fourth paly of six, or and sable, a bend
counterchanged; second and third, quarterly,
argent and gules, a cross bottony counterchanged.
<i>Crest</i>: on a ducal coronet proper,
two pennons, the dexter or, the sinister sable;
the staves, gules. <i>Supporters</i>: two leopards,
guardant coward, proper. <i>Motto: Fatti maschii,
parole femine.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">The first great seal of the Province was lost
during Ingle’s Rebellion; and in 1648 the Proprietary
sent out another seal, slightly different.
This seal had engraven on one side the figure of
the Proprietary in armor on horseback, with
drawn sword and a helmet with a great plume of
feathers, the trappings being adorned with the
family arms. The inscription round about this
side was: <i>Cecilius absolutus dominus Terra Mariæ
et Avaloniæ Baro de Baltimore</i>. On the
other side of the seal was engraven a scutcheon
with the family arms; namely, six pieces impaled
with a band dexter counterchanged, quartered
with a cross bottony, and counterchanged; the
whole scutcheon being supported with a fisherman
on one side and a ploughman on the other
(in the place of the family leopards), standing
upon a scroll, whereon the Baltimore motto was
inscribed; namely, <i>Fatti maschii, parole femine</i>.
Above the scutcheon was a count-palatine’s cap,
and over that a helmet, with the crest of the
family arms; namely, a ducal crown with two
half bannerets set upright. Behind the scutcheon
and supporters was engraven a large ermine
mantle, and the inscription about this side of the
seal was, <i>Scuto bonæ voluntatis tuæ coronasti nos</i>.
In 1657 Lord Baltimore sent out another seal,
similar in design, which was used till 1705. Subsequent
changes were made in the seal and
arms of the Province and State, but in 1876 the
last described side of the Great Seal sent out
in 1648 was adopted as the arms of Maryland.
A full account of the pedigree of the Calverts
will be found in <i>An Appeal to the citizens of Maryland,
from the legitimate descendants of the Baltimore
family</i>, by Charles Browning, Baltimore,
1821. [Fuller’s <i>Worthies of England</i> and Anthony
Wood’s <i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i> give us important

[Following Chalmers, it had been often
stated that the Assembly of 1649 was Catholic
by majority; but four or five years before this
publication of Davis, Mr. Sebastian F. Streeter,
in his <i>Maryland Two Hundred Years Ago</i>, had
claimed that the Assembly which passed the
Toleration Act was by majority Protestant, for
which, so late as January, 1869, he was taken to
task in the <i>Southern Review</i> by Richard McSherry,
M.D., who reprinted his paper in his <i>Essays
and Lectures</i>. The question of the relations of
Protestant and Catholic to the spirit of toleration
is discussed by E. D. Neill, in his “Lord
Baltimore and Toleration in Maryland,” in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, September, 1876; by B.
F. Brown, in his <i>Early Religious History of Maryland:
Maryland not a Roman Catholic Colony</i>,
1876; in “Early Catholic Legislation, 1634-49,
on Religious Freedom,” in the <i>New Englander</i>,
November, 1878. The Rev. Ethan Allen, in his
<i>Who were the Early Settlers of Maryland?</i> published
by the Historical Society in 1865, aimed
to show that the vast majority were Protestant.
Kennedy also had asserted that the Assembly
of 1649 was Protestant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

in 1876; and <i>English Colonization of America</i>,

A manuscript copy of this charter, both in
Latin and English, is in the Maryland Historical
Society. Many writers, including the Rev. E. D.
Neill, so late as 1871, in his <i>English Colonization
in the Seventeenth Century</i>, have made the mistake
of supposing that the charter of Maryland
was copied from the charter of Carolina, granted
in 1629 to Sir Robert Heath. The last two
named charters were both copied from the charter
of Avalon, issued in 1623. [The Maryland
charter of June 20, 1632, is printed by Scharf, i.
53, following Thomas Bacon’s translation, as
given in his edition of the Laws, Annapolis, 1765;
where is also the original Latin, which is likewise
in Hazard’s <i>Collection</i>, i. 327. Lord Baltimore
had printed it in London, in 1723, in a
collection of the Acts, 1692-1715,&mdash;an edition
which Bacon had never found in the Province.
See the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, No. 3657. The Philadelphia
Library has an edition printed in Philadelphia
in 1718.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[The Rev. John G. Morris, D.D., began a
Bibliography of Maryland in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>
(April and May, 1870), but it was never
carried beyond “Baltimore.” If a topical index
is furnished to Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, when completed,
it may supply the deficiency; but in the
mean time the articles “Baltimore” and “Maryland”
can be consulted. Of the local works
references may be made to a few: George A.
Hanson’s <i>Old Kent</i>, 1876, is largely genealogical,
and not lucidly arranged. T. W. Griffith published
in 1821 his <i>Sketches of the Early History
of Maryland</i>, and in 1841 his <i>Annals of Baltimore</i>.
J. T. Scharf published his <i>Chronicles
of Baltimore</i> in 1874. David Ridgely published
in 1841 his <i>Annals of Annapolis</i> (1649-1872).
Rev. Ethan Allen’s <i>Historical Notes of St. Ann’s
Parish</i> (1649-1857), appeared in 1857; and
George Johnstone’s <i>History of Cecil County</i> in
1881.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[Mr. Gladstone was answered by Dr. Richard
H. Clarke, in the <i>Catholic World</i>, December,
1875, in a paper which was later issued as a
pamphlet, with the title, <i>Mr. Gladstone and Maryland
Toleration</i>. Mr. Gladstone had reissued
his <i>Vaticanism</i> essays with a preface, styling the
book, <i>Rome and the Newest Fashions in Religion</i>,
in which he reiterated his arguments.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is perhaps largely owing to the deficiency
of early personal narratives bearing upon Maryland
history and throwing light upon character,
that there is so much diversity of opinion regarding
the interpretation to be put on the charter as
an instrument inculcating toleration. The shades
of dissent, too, are marked. Hildreth, <i>History
of the United States</i>, says, “There is not the least
hint of any toleration in religion not authorized
by the law of England.” Henry Cabot Lodge,
<i>Short History of the English Colonies</i>, p. 96, says,
“There is no toleration about the Maryland
charter.” Some light regarding Calvert, on the
side of doubt, may be gathered from Gardiner’s
<i>Prince Charles and the Spanish Marriage</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Baltimore’s controversy with Clayborne,
the side of the latter has been espoused by Mr.
Streeter in his <i>Life and Colonial Times of William
Claiborne</i>, which he has left in manuscript,
and of which an abstract of the part relating to
Clayborne’s Rebellion is given by Mr. S. M.
Allen in the <i>New England Historical and Genealogical
Register</i>, April, 1873. Mr. Streeter was
of New England origin, a graduate of Harvard
(1831), and had removed to Richmond in 1835,
and to Baltimore the following year, where he
had been one of the founders, and was long the
Recording Secretary of the Maryland Historical
Society. He contributed also in 1868 to its
<i>Fund Publication</i> (No. 2), <i>The First Commander
of Kent Island</i>,&mdash;an account of George Evelin,
under whose administration the island passed
into Calvert’s control. This tract has been reprinted
in G. D. Scull’s <i>Evelyns in America</i>,
privately printed at Oxford (England), 1881.
Streeter’s “Fall of the Susquehannocks,” a
chapter of Maryland’s Indian history, 1675,
appeared in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, March,
1857, being an extract only from a voluminous
manuscript work by him on the Susquehannocks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
